<h2 style="font-size:smaller;">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h2>

<p>The source code for this HTML page contains only Latin-1 characters, but
it directs the browser to display some special characters. The original
work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are
represented here as Greek letters, for example
<span title="Liakyra">&#923;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#965;&#961;&#945;</span>.
If the mouse is held still over such phrases, a transliteration in Beta-code pops up.
Aside from Greek letters, the only unusual characters are
&#257; (a with macron), &#299; (i with macron), and &#275; (e with macron).
</p>

<p>An important feature of this edition is its copious notes,
which are of three types. Notes indexed with both a number and a letter,
for example [4.B.], are end-notes provided by Byron or, following Canto IV,
by J.&nbsp;C. Hobhouse. These end-notes follow each Canto.</p>

<p>Both the verse and the end-notes have footnotes, which
are indicated by small raised keys in brackets; these are links to the
footnote's text. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers (e.g. [17],
[221]) are informational. Footnotes indexed with
letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) document variant forms of the text from
manuscripts and other sources.</p>

<p>In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected following each canto or
block of end-notes, and have been numbered consecutively throughout.
Text in footnotes and end-notes in square brackets is the work of Editor
E.&nbsp;H. Coleridge. Text not in brackets is by Byron or Hobhouse. In
certain notes on variant text, the editor showed deleted text struck
through with lines, for example <span class="lineout">deleted words</span>.</p>

<p>Navigation aids are provided as follows. Page numbers are displayed at
the right edge of the window.
To jump directly to page <i>nn</i>, append #Page_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.
To jump directly to the text of footnote <i>xx</i>, either search for [<i>xx</i>]
or append #Footnote_<i>xx</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>Within the blocks of footnotes, numbers in braces such as {321}
represent the page number on which following notes originally appeared.
These numbers are also preserved as HTML anchors of the form Note_321.
To find notes originally printed on page <i>nn</i>, either search
for the string {<i>nn</i>} or append #Note_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE_VOLUME" id="PREFACE_VOLUME"></a>
PREFACE TO THE SECOND VOLUME.
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> text of the present edition of
<i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>
is based upon a collation of volume i. of
the Library Edition, 1855, with the following MSS.:
(i.) the original MS. of the First and Second Cantos,
in Byron's handwriting [MS. M.];
(ii.) a transcript
of the First and Second Cantos, in the handwriting of
R. C. Dallas [D.];
(iii.) a transcript of the Third
Canto, in the handwriting of Clara Jane Clairmont [C.];
(iv.) a collection of "scraps," forming a first draft
of the Third Canto, in Byron's handwriting [MS.];
(v.) a fair copy of the first draft of the Fourth Canto,
together with the MS. of the additional stanzas, in
Byron's handwriting. [MS. M.];
(vi.) a second fair copy
of the Fourth Canto, as completed, in Byron's handwriting [D.].</p>

<p>The text of the First and Second Cantos has also
been collated with the text of the First Edition of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
First and Second Cantos (quarto, 1812); the text of
the Third and of the Fourth Cantos with the texts of the
First Editions of 1816 and 1818 respectively; and the
text of the entire poem with that issued in the collected
editions of 1831 and 1832.</p>

<p>Considerations of space have determined the position
and arrangement of the notes.</p>

<p>Byron's notes to the First, Second, and Third
Cantos, and Hobhouse's notes to the Fourth Canto are
printed, according to precedent, at the end of each canto.</p>

<p>Editorial notes are placed in square brackets. Notes
illustrative of the text are printed immediately below the
variants. Notes illustrative of Byron's notes or footnotes
are appended to the originals or printed as footnotes.
Byron's own notes to the Fourth Canto are printed
as footnotes to the text.</p>

<p>Hobhouse's "Historical Notes" are reprinted without
addition or comment; but the numerous and intricate
references to classical, historical, and arch&aelig;ological
authorities have been carefully verified, and in many
instances rewritten.</p>

<p>In compiling the Introductions, the additional notes,
and footnotes, I have endeavoured to supply the reader
with a compendious manual of reference. With the
subject-matter of large portions of the three distinct
poems which make up the five hundred stanzas of
<i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> every one is more or less
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
familiar, but details and particulars are out of the
immediate reach of even the most cultivated readers.</p>

<p>The poem may be dealt with in two ways. It may
be regarded as a repertory or treasury of brilliant passages
for selection and quotation; or it may be read continuously,
and with some attention to the style and
message of the author. It is in the belief that
<i>Childe Harold</i> should be read continuously, and that it gains by
the closest study, reassuming its original freshness and
splendour, that the text as well as Byron's own notes
have been somewhat minutely annotated.</p>

<p>In the selection and composition of the notes I have,
in addition to other authorities, consulted and made use
of the following editions of <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage:</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>i. <i>&Eacute;dition Classique</i>, par James Darmesteter,
Docteur-&egrave;s-lettres. Paris, 1882.</p>

<p>ii. Byron's <i>Childe Harold</i>, edited, with Introduction
and Notes, by H. F. Tozer, M.A. Oxford, 1885
(Clarendon Press Series).</p>

<p>iii. <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>, edited by the Rev.
E.C. Everard Owen, M.A. London, 1897 (Arnold's British Classics).</p>

<p>Particular acknowledgments of my indebtedness to
these admirable works will be found throughout the volume.</p>

<p>I have consulted and derived assistance from
Professor Eugen K&ouml;lbing's exhaustive collation of the
text of the two first cantos with the Dallas Transcript in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
the British Museum (<i>Zur Text&uuml;berlieferung von Byron's
Childe Harold, Cantos I., II. Leipsic</i>, 1896); and I am
indebted to the same high authority for information with
regard to the Seventh Edition (1814) of the First and
Second Cantos. (See <i>Bemerkungen zu Byron's Childe
Harold, Engl. Stud.</i>, 1896, xxi. 176-186.)</p>

<p>I have again to record my grateful acknowledgments
to Dr. Richard Garnett, C.B., Dr. A. S. Murray, F.R.S.,
Mr. R. E. Graves, Mr. E. D. Butler, F.R.G.S., and
other officials of the British Museum, for constant help
and encouragement in the preparation of the notes to
<i>Childe Harold.</i></p>

<p>I desire to express my thanks to Dr. H. R. Mill,
Librarian of the Royal Geographical Society; Mr. J. C.
Baker, F.R.S., Keeper of the Herbarium and Library of
the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Mr. Horatio F. Brown
(author of <i>Venice, an Historical Sketch</i>, etc.); Mr. P. A.
Daniel, Mr. Richard Edgcumbe, and others, for valuable
information on various points of doubt and difficulty.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Publisher, I beg to acknowledge
the kindness of his Grace the Duke of Richmond, in
permitting Cosway's miniature of Charlotte Duchess of
Richmond to be reproduced for this volume.</p>

<p>I have also to thank Mr. Horatio F. Brown for the
right to reproduce the interesting portrait of "Byron at
Venice," which is now in his possession.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_FIRST" id="INTRODUCTION_FIRST"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO<br />
THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS OF<br />
<i>CHILDE HAROLD</i>.
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> First Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> was begun at Janina, in
Albania, October 31, 1809, and the Second Canto was finished
at Smyrna, March 28, 1810. The dates were duly recorded
on the MS.; but in none of the letters which Byron wrote to
his mother and his friends from the East does he mention or
allude to the composition or existence of such a work. In
one letter, however, to his mother (January 14, 1811, <i>Letters</i>,
1898, i. 308), he informs her that he has MSS. in his possession
which may serve to prolong his memory, if his heirs and
executors "think proper to publish them;" but for himself,
he has "done with authorship." Three months later the
achievement of <i>Hints from Horace</i> and <i>The Curse of
Minerva</i> persuaded him to give "authorship" another trial;
and, in a letter written on board the <i>Volage</i> frigate (June
28, <i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 313), he announces to his literary Mentor,
R. C. Dallas, who had superintended the publication of
<i>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers</i>, that he has "an
imitation of the <i>Ars Poetica</i> of Horace ready for Cawthorne."
Byron landed in England on July 2, and on the 15th Dallas
"had the pleasure of shaking hands with him at Reddish's
Hotel, St. James's Street" (<i>Recollections of the Life of Lord
Byron</i>, 1824, p. 103). There was a crowd of visitors, says
Dallas, and no time for conversation; but the <i>Imitation</i> was
placed in his hands. He took it home, read it, and was disappointed.
Disparagement was out of the question; but the
next morning at breakfast Dallas ventured to express some
surprise that he had written nothing else. An admission or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
confession followed that "he had occasionally written short
poems, besides a great many stanzas in Spenser's measure,
relative to the countries he had visited." "They are not," he
added, "worth troubling you with, but you shall have them
all with you if you like." "So," says Dallas, "came I by
<i>Childe Harold</i>. He took it from a small trunk, with a
number of verses."</p>

<p>Dallas was "delighted," and on the evening of the same
day (July 16)&mdash;before, let us hope, and not after, he had consulted
his "Ionian friend," Walter Rodwell Wright
(see <i>Recollections</i>, p. 151,
and <i>Diary</i> of H.C. Robinson, 1872, i. 17)&mdash;he
despatched a letter of enthusiastic approval, which
gratified Byron, but did not convince him of the extraordinary
merit of his work, or of its certainty of success. It was,
however, agreed that the MS. should be left with Dallas,
that he should arrange for its publication and hold the
copyright. Dallas would have entrusted the poem to Cawthorne,
who had published
<i>English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers,</i>
and with whom, as Byron's intermediary, he was
in communication; but Byron objected on the ground that
the firm did not "stand high enough in the trade," and
Longmans, who had been offered but had declined the
<i>English Bards</i>, were in no case to be approached. An
application to Miller, of Albemarle Street, came to nothing,
because Miller was Lord Elgin's bookseller and publisher
(he had just brought out the
<i>Memorandum on Lord Elgin's Pursuits in Greece</i>),
and <i>Childe Harold</i> denounced and
reviled Lord Elgin. But Murray, of Fleet Street, who had
already expressed a wish to publish for Lord Byron, was
willing to take the matter into consideration. On the first
of August Byron lost his mother, on the third his friend
Matthews was drowned in the Cam, and for some weeks he
could devote neither time nor thought to the fortunes of
his poem; but Dallas had bestirred himself, and on the
eighteenth was able to report that he had "seen Murray
again," and that Murray was anxious that Byron's name
should appear on the title-page.</p>

<p>To this request Byron somewhat reluctantly acceded
(August 21); and a few days later (August 25) he informs
Dallas that he has sent him "exordiums, annotations, etc.,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
for the forthcoming quarto," and has written to Murray,
urging him on no account to show the MS. to Juvenal, that is,
Gifford. But Gifford, as a matter of course, had been already
consulted, had read the First Canto, and had advised Murray
to publish the poem. Byron was, or pretended to be, furious;
but the solid fact that Gifford had commended his work
acted like a charm, and his fury subsided. On the fifth of
September (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 24, note) he received from
Murray the first proof, and by December 14 "the Pilgrimage
was concluded," and all but the preface had been printed
and seen through the press.</p>

<p>The original draft of the poem, which Byron took out of
"the little trunk" and gave to Dallas, had undergone considerable
alterations and modifications before this date.
Both Dallas and Murray took exception to certain stanzas
which, on personal, or patriotic, or religious considerations,
were provocative and objectionable. They were apprehensive,
not only for the sale of the book, but for the reputation
of its author. Byron fought his ground inch by inch, but
finally assented to a compromise. He was willing to cut out
three stanzas on the Convention of Cintra, which had ceased
to be a burning question, and four more stanzas at the end
of the First Canto, which reflected on the Duke of Wellington,
Lord Holland, and other persons of less note. A stanza
on Beckford in the First Canto, and two stanzas in the
second on Lord Elgin, Thomas Hope, and the "Dilettanti
crew," were also omitted. Stanza ix. of the Second Canto,
on the immortality of the soul, was recast, and "sure and
certain" hopelessness exchanged for a pious, if hypothetical,
aspiration. But with regard to the general tenor of his
politics and metaphysics, Byron stood firm, and awaited the issue.</p>

<p>There were additions as well as omissions. The first
stanza of the First Canto, stanzas xliii. and xc., which
celebrate the battles of Albuera and Talavera; the stanzas
to the memory of Charles Skinner Matthews, nos. xci., xcii.;
and stanzas ix., xcv.,xcvi. of the Second Canto, which record
Byron's grief for the death of an unknown lover or friend,
apparently (letter to Dallas, October 31, 1811) the mysterious
Thyrza, and others (<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_xvi">note on the MSS. of
the First and Second Cantos</a> of <i>Childe Harold</i>),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
were composed
at Newstead, in the autumn of 1811. <i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i>,
quarto, was published on Tuesday, March 10,
1812&mdash;Moore (<i>Life</i>, p. 157) implies that the date of issue was
Saturday, February 29; and Dallas (<i>Recollections</i>, p. 220)
says that he obtained a copy on Tuesday, March 3 (but see
advertisements in the <i>Times</i> and <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of
Thursday, March 5, announcing future publication, and in
the <i>Courier</i> and <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Tuesday, March 10,
announcing first appearance)&mdash;and in three days an edition
of five hundred copies was sold. A second edition, octavo,
with six additional poems (fourteen poems were included in
the First Edition), was issued on April 17; a third on June 27;
a fourth, with the "Addition to the Preface," on September 14;
and a fifth on December 5, 1812,&mdash;the day on which Murray
"acquainted his friends" (see advertisement in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>) that he had removed from Fleet Street to No. 50,
Albemarle Street. A sixth edition, identical with the fifth
and fourth editions, was issued August 11, 1813; and, on
February 1, 1814 (see letter to Murray, February 4, 1814),
<i>Childe Harold</i> made a "seventh appearance." The seventh
edition was a new departure altogether. Not only were nine
poems added to the twenty already published, but a dedication
to Lady Charlotte Harley ("Ianthe"), written in the autumn
of 1812, was prefixed to the First Canto, and ten additional
stanzas were inserted towards the end of the Second Canto.
<i>Childe Harold</i>, as we have it, differs to that extent from the
<i>Childe Harold</i> which, in a day and a night, made Byron
"famous." The dedication to Ianthe was the outcome of a
visit to Eywood, and his devotion to Ianthe's mother, Lady
Oxford; but the new stanzas were probably written in 1810.
In a letter to Dallas, September 7, 1811 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii.
28), he writes, "I had projected an additional canto when I
was in the Troad and Constantinople, and if I saw them
again, it would go on." This seems to imply that a beginning
had been made. In a poem, a hitherto unpublished
fragment entitled <i>Il Diavolo Inamorato</i> (<i>vide post</i>, vol. iii.),
which is dated August 31, 1812, five stanzas and a half, viz.
stanzas lxxiii. lines 5-9, lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxii., xxvii. of the
Second Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> are imbedded; and these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
form part of the ten additional stanzas which were first
published in the seventh edition. There is, too, the fragment
entitled <i>The Monk of Athos</i>, which was first published
(<i>Life of Lord Byron</i>, by the Hon. Roden Noel) in 1890, which
may have formed part of this projected Third Canto.</p>

<p>No further alterations were made in the text of the poem;
but an eleventh edition of <i>Childe Harold</i>, Cantos I., II., was
published in 1819.</p>

<p>The demerits of <i>Childe Harold</i> lie on the surface; but it is
difficult for the modern reader, familiar with the sight, if not
the texture, of "the purple patches," and unattracted, perhaps
demagnetized, by a personality once fascinating and always
"puissant," to appreciate the actual worth and magnitude
of the poem. We are "o'er informed;" and as with Nature,
so with Art, the eye must be couched, and the film of association
removed, before we can see clearly. But there is one
characteristic feature of <i>Childe Harold</i> which association and
familiarity have been powerless to veil or confuse&mdash;originality
of design. "By what accident," asks the Quarterly Reviewer
(George Agar Ellis), "has it happened that no other English
poet before Lord Byron has thought fit to employ his talents
on a subject so well suited to their display?" The question
can only be answered by the assertion that it was the accident
of genius which inspired the poet with a "new song."
<i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> had no progenitors, and, with
the exception of some feeble and forgotten imitations, it has
had no descendants. The materials of the poem; the Spenserian
stanza, suggested, perhaps, by Campbell's
<i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i>, as well as by older models; the language, the
metaphors, often appropriated and sometimes stolen from the
Bible, from Shakespeare, from the classics; the sentiments
and reflections coeval with reflection and sentiment, wear a
familiar hue; but the poem itself, a pilgrimage to scenes and
cities of renown, a song of travel, a rhythmical diorama,
was Byron's own handiwork&mdash;not an inheritance, but a creation.</p>

<p>But what of the eponymous hero, the sated and melancholy
"Childe," with his attendant page and yeoman, his backward
glances on "heartless parasites," on "laughing dames," on
goblets and other properties of "the monastic dome"? Is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Childe Harold Byron masquerading in disguise, or is he
intended to be a fictitious personage, who, half unconsciously,
reveals the author's personality? Byron deals with the question
in a letter to Dallas (October 31): "I by no means intend to
identify myself with <i>Harold</i>, but to <i>deny</i> all connection with
him. If in parts I may be thought to have drawn from myself,
believe me it is but in parts, and I shall not own even
to that." He adds, with evident sincerity, "I would not be
such a fellow as I have made my hero for all the world."
Again, in the preface, "Harold is the child of imagination."
This pronouncement was not the whole truth; but it is truer
than it seems. He was well aware that Byron had sate for
the portrait of Childe Harold. He had begun by calling his
hero Childe Burun, and the few particulars which he gives
of Childe Burun's past were particulars, in the main exact
particulars, of Byron's own history. He had no motive for
concealment, for, so little did he know himself, he imagined
that he was not writing for publication, that he had done
with authorship. Even when the mood had passed, it was
the imitation of the <i>Ars Poetica</i>, not <i>Childe Harold</i>, which
he was eager to publish; and when <i>Childe Harold</i> had been
offered to and accepted by a publisher, he desired and proposed
that it should appear anonymously. He had not as
yet come to the pass of displaying "the pageant of his
bleeding heart" before the eyes of the multitude. But though
he shrank from the obvious and inevitable conclusion that
Childe Harold was Byron in disguise, and idly "disclaimed"
all connection, it was true that he had intended to draw a
fictitious character, a being whom he may have feared he
might one day become, but whom he did not recognize as
himself. He was not sated, he was not cheerless, he was
not unamiable. He was all a-quiver with youth and enthusiasm
and the joy of great living. He had left behind him
friends whom he knew were not "the flatterers of the festal
hour"&mdash;friends whom he returned to mourn and nobly
celebrate. Byron was not Harold, but Harold was an ideal
Byron, the creature and avenger of his pride, which haunted
and pursued its presumptuous creator to the bitter end.</p>

<p><i>Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</i> was reviewed, or rather
advertised, by Dallas, in the <i>Literary Panorama</i> for March,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
1812. To the reviewer's dismay, the article, which appeared
before the poem was out, was shown to Byron, who was
paying a short visit to his old friends at Harrow. Dallas
quaked, but "as it proved no bad advertisement," he escaped
censure. "The blunder passed unobserved, eclipsed by
the dazzling brilliancy of the object which had caused it"
(<i>Recollections</i>, p. 221).</p>

<p>Of the greater reviews, the <i>Quarterly</i> (No. xiii., March,
1812) was published on May 12, and the <i>Edinburgh</i> (No. 38,
June, 1812) was published on August 5, 1812.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<br />
<span style="font-size:90%;">[TO THE FIRST AND SECOND CANTOS.]</span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following poem was written, for the most part, amidst
the scenes which it attempts<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[b]</a> to describe. It was begun in
Albania; and the parts relative to Spain and Portugal were
composed from the author's observations in those countries.
Thus much it may be necessary to state for the correctness
of the descriptions. The scenes attempted to be sketched
are in Spain, Portugal, Epirus, Acarnania and Greece.
There, for the present, the poem stops: its reception will
determine whether the author may venture to conduct his
readers to the capital of the East, through Ionia and Phrygia:
these two cantos are merely experimental.</p>

<p>A fictitious character is introduced for the sake of giving
some connection to the piece; which, however, makes no
pretension to regularity. It has been suggested to me by
friends, on whose opinions I set a high value,<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[c]</a>&mdash;that in this
fictitious character, "Childe Harold," I may incur the suspicion
of having intended some real personage: this I beg
leave, once for all, to disclaim&mdash;Harold is the child of imagination,
for the purpose I have stated.</p>

<p>In some very trivial particulars, and those merely local,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
there might be grounds for such a notion;<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[d]</a> but in the main
points, I should hope, none whatever.<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E"></a><a href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[e]</a></p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to mention that the appellation
"Childe,"<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as "Childe Waters," "Childe Childers," etc., is
used as more consonant with the old structure of versification
which I have adopted. The "Good Night" in the beginning
of the first Canto, was suggested by Lord Maxwell's "Good
Night"<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the <i>Border Minstrelsy</i>, edited by Mr. Scott.</p>

<p>With the different poems<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which have been published on
Spanish subjects, there may be found some slight coincidence<a name="FNanchor_F" id="FNanchor_F"></a><a href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">[f]</a>
in the first part, which treats of the Peninsula, but it can only
be casual; as, with the exception of a few concluding stanzas,
the whole of the poem was written in the Levant.</p>

<p>The stanza of Spenser, according to one of our most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
successful poets, admits of every variety. Dr. Beattie makes
the following observation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not long ago I began a poem in the style and stanza of
Spenser, in which I propose to give full scope to my inclination,
and be either droll or pathetic, descriptive or sentimental,
tender or satirical, as the humour strikes me; for, if
I mistake not, the measure which I have adopted admits
equally of all these kinds of composition."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Strengthened in
my opinion by such authority, and by the example of some
in the highest order of Italian poets, I shall make no apology
for attempts at similar variations in the following composition;<a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G"></a><a href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[g]</a>
satisfied that, if they are unsuccessful, their failure
must be in the execution, rather than in the design sanctioned
by the practice of Ariosto, Thomson, and Beattie.</p>

<p>London, February, 1812.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>ADDITION TO THE PREFACE.</h3>

<p>I have now waited till almost all our periodical journals
have distributed their usual portion of criticism. To the
justice of the generality of their criticisms I have nothing to
object; it would ill become me to quarrel with their very
slight degree of censure, when, perhaps, if they had been less
kind they had been more candid. Returning, therefore, to
all and each my best thanks for their liberality, on one point
alone I shall venture an observation. Amongst the many
objections justly urged to the very indifferent character of the
"vagrant Childe" (whom, notwithstanding many hints to the
contrary, I still maintain to be a fictitious personage), it has
been stated, that, besides the anachronism, he is very
<i>unknightly</i>, as the times of the Knights were times of Love,
Honour, and so forth.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Now it so happens that the good old
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
times, when "l'amour du bon vieux tems, l'amour antique,"
flourished, were the most profligate of all possible centuries.
Those who have any doubts on this subject may consult
Sainte-Palaye, <i>passim</i>, and more particularly vol. ii. p. 69.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The vows of chivalry were no better kept than any other
vows whatsoever; and the songs of the Troubadours were
not more decent, and certainly were much less refined, than
those of Ovid. The "Cours d'Amour, parlemens d'amour, ou
de courtoisie et de gentilesse" had much more of love than of
courtesy or gentleness. See Rolland<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> on the same subject
with Sainte-Palaye.</p>

<p>Whatever other objection may be urged to that most unamiable
personage Childe Harold, he was so far perfectly
knightly in his attributes&mdash;"No waiter, but a knight templar."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
By the by, I fear that Sir Tristrem and Sir Lancelot were
no better than they should be, although very poetical personages
and true knights, "sans peur," though not "sans
r&eacute;proche." If the story of the institution of the "Garter" be
not a fable, the knights of that order have for several centuries
borne the badge of a Countess of Salisbury, of indifferent
memory. So much for chivalry. Burke need not have
regretted that its days are over, though Marie-Antoinette was
quite as chaste as most of those in whose honour lances were
shivered, and knights unhorsed.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Before the days of Bayard, and down to those of Sir Joseph
Banks<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (the most chaste and celebrated of ancient and modern
times) few exceptions will be found to this statement; and I
fear a little investigation will teach us not to regret these
monstrous mummeries of the middle ages.</p>

<p>I now leave "Childe Harold" to live his day such as he is;
it had been more agreeable, and certainly more easy, to have
drawn an amiable character. It had been easy to varnish
over his faults, to make him do more and express less, but he
never was intended as an example, further than to show,
that early perversion of mind and morals leads to satiety of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
past pleasures and disappointment in new ones, and that
even the beauties of nature and the stimulus of travel (except
ambition, the most powerful of all excitements) are lost on a
soul so constituted, or rather misdirected. Had I proceeded
with the Poem, this character would have deepened as he
drew to the close; for the outline which I once meant to fill
up for him was, with some exceptions, the sketch of a modern
Timon,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> perhaps a poetical
Zeluco.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>

written in separate portions by the noble author. They were afterwards
arranged for publication; and when thus arranged, the whole was copied.
This copy was placed in Lord Byron's hands, and he made various
alterations, corrections, and large additions. These, together with the
notes, are in his Lordship's own handwriting. The manuscript thus
corrected was sent to the press, and was printed under the direction of
Robt. Chas. Dallas, Esq., to whom Lord Byron had given the copyright of
the poem. The MS., as it came from the printers, was preserved by Mr.

"The moral code of chivalry was not, we admit, quite pure and spotless,
but its laxity on some points was redeemed by the noble spirit of
gallantry which courted personal danger in the defence of the sovereign
... of women because they are often lovely, and always helpless; and of
the priesthood.... Now, <i>Childe Harold</i>, if not absolutely craven and
recreant, is at least a mortal enemy to all martial exertion, a scoffer
at the fair sex, and, apparently, disposed to consider all religions as
different modes of superstition." The tone of the review is severer than
the Preface indicates. Nor does Byron attempt to reply to the main issue
of the indictment, an unknightly aversion from war, but rides off on a
minor point, the licentiousness of the Troubadours.]</p></div>

in 1823, Captain Anthony Bacon (died July 2, 1864), who had followed
"young, gallant Howard" (see <i>Childe Harold</i>, III. xxix.) in his last
fatal charge at Waterloo, and who, subsequently, during the progress of
the civil war between Dom Miguel and Maria da Gloria of Portugal
(1828-33), held command as colonel of cavalry in the Queen's forces, and
finally as a general officer. Lady Charlotte Bacon died May 9, 1880.
Byron's acquaintance with her probably dated from his visit to Lord and
Lady Oxford, at Eywood House, in Herefordshire, in October-November,
1812. Her portrait, by Westall, which was painted at his request, is
included among the illustrations in Finden's <i>Illustrations of the Life

1809] to Newstead together, where I had got a famous cellar, and
<i>Monks'</i> dresses from a masquerade warehouse. We were a company of some
seven or eight, ... and used to sit up late in our friars' dresses,
drinking burgundy, claret, champagne, and what not, out of the
<i>skull-cup</i>, and all sorts of glasses, and buffooning all round the
house, in our conventual garments" (letter to Murray, November 19, 1820.
See, too, the account of this visit which Matthews wrote to his sister
in a letter dated May 22, 1809 [<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 150-160, and 153,
note]). Moore (<i>Life</i>, p. 86) and other apologists are anxious to point
out that the Newstead "wassailers" were, on the whole, a harmless crew
of rollicking schoolboys "&mdash;were, indeed, of habits and tastes too
intellectual for mere vulgar debauchery." And as to the "alleged
'harems,'" the "Paphian girls," there were only one or two, says Moore,
"among the ordinary menials." But, even so, the "wassailers" were not
impeccable, and it is best to leave the story, fact or fable, to speak
for itself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The "trivial particular" which suggested to Byron the
friendlessness and desolation of the Childe may be explained by the
refusal of an old schoolfellow to spend the last day with him before he
set out on his travels. The friend, possibly Lord Delawarr, excused
himself on the plea that "he was engaged with his mother and some ladies
to go shopping." "Friendship!" he exclaimed to Dallas. "I do not believe
I shall leave behind me, yourself and family excepted, and, perhaps, my
mother, a single being who will care what becomes of me" (Dallas,
<i>Recollections, etc.</i>, pp. 63, 64). Byron, to quote Charles Lamb's
apology for Coleridge, was "full of fun," and must not be taken too
seriously. Doubtless he was piqued at the moment, and afterwards, to
heighten the tragedy of Childe Harold's exile, expanded a single act of
negligence into general abandonment and desertion at the hour of trial.</p></div>

(see p. 27, <i>var.</i> ii.), the Childe complains that he has not seen his
sister for "three long years and moe." Before her marriage, in 1807,
Augusta Byron divided her time between her mother's children, Lady
Chichester and the Duke of Leeds; her cousin, Lord Carlisle; and General
and Mrs. Harcourt. After her marriage to Colonel Leigh, she lived at
Newmarket. From the end of 1805 Byron corresponded with her more or less
regularly, but no meeting took place. In a letter to his sister, dated
November 30, 1808 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 203), he writes, "I saw Col.
Leigh at Brighton in July, where I should have been glad to have seen
you; I only know your husband by sight." Colonel Leigh was his first
cousin, as well as his half-sister's husband, and the incidental remark
that "he only knew him by sight" affords striking proof that his
relations and connections were at no pains to seek him out, but left him
to fight his own way to social recognition and distinction. (For
particulars of "the Hon. Augusta Byron," see <i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 18,
note.)]</p></div>

Byron was recalling an incident which had befallen him some time
previously (see letter to Moore, January 19, 1815): "When I thought he
was going to enact Argus, he bit away the backside of my breeches, and
never would consent to any kind of recognition, in despite of all kinds
of bones which I offered him." See, too, for another thrust at Argus,
<i>Don Juan</i>, Canto III. stanza xxiii. But he should have remembered that
this particular Argus "was half a <i>wolf</i> by the she side." His portrait
is preserved at Newstead (see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1898, i. 280, <i>Edition
de Luxe</i>).

1834), the reissue of his <i>Letters Picturesque and Poetical</i> (4to,
1783).
</p><p>
"Our first object was the convent of Nossa Senhora da Penha, the little
romantic pile of white building I had seen glittering from afar when I
first sailed by the coast of Lisbon. From this pyramidical elevation the
view is boundless; you look immediately down upon an immense expanse of
sea.
</p><p>
... A long series of detached clouds of a dazzling whiteness suspended
low over the waves had a magic effect, and in pagan times might have
appeared, without any great stretch of fancy, the cars of marine
divinities, just risen from the bosom of their element."&mdash;<i>Italy, etc.</i>,
p. 249.
</p><p>
"Before the entrance, formed by two ledges of ponderous rock, extends a
smooth level of greensward.... The Hermitage, its cell, chapel, and
refectory, are all scooped out of the native marble, and lined with the
bark of the cork tree. Several of the passages are not only roofed, but
floored with the same material ... The shrubberies and garden-plots
dispersed amongst the mossy rocks ... are delightful, and I took great
pleasure in ... following the course of a transparent rill, which was
conducted through a rustic water-shoot, between bushes of lavender and
roses, many of the tenderest green."&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 250.

[The crosses made no impression upon Hobhouse, who, no doubt, had
realized that they were nothing but guideposts. For an explanation, see
letter of Mr. Matthew Lewtas to the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, July 19, 1873: "The
track from the main road to the convent, rugged and devious, leading up
to the mountain, is marked out by numerous crosses now, just as it was
when Byron rode along it in 1809, and it would appear he fell into the
mistake of considering that the crosses were erected to show where
assassinations had been committed."]</p></div>

[Beckford, describing the view from the convent, notices
the wild flowers which adorned "the ruined splendour." "Amidst the
crevices of the mouldering walls ... I noticed some capillaries and
polypodiums of infinite delicacy; and on a little flat space before the
convent a numerous tribe of pinks, gentians, and other Alpine plants,
fanned and invigorated by the fresh mountain air."&mdash;<i>Italy, etc.,</i> 1834,

in French in 1784, and in English in 1787. He spent two years (1794-96)
in retirement at Quinta da Monserrate, three miles from Cintra. Byron
thought highly of <i>Vathek</i>. "I do not know," he writes (<i>The Giaour</i>, l.
1328, note), "from what source the author ... may have drawn his
materials ... but for correctness of costume ... and power of
imagination, it surpasses all European imitations.... As an Eastern
tale, even <i>Rasselas</i> must bow before it; his happy valley will not bear
a comparison with the 'Hall of Eblis.'" In the MS. there is an
additional stanza reflecting on Beckford, which Dallas induced him to
omit. It was afterwards included by Moore among the <i>Occasional Pieces</i>,
under the title of <i>To Dives: a Fragment</i> (<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1883, p.

is dated September 3, and was published in the <i>London Gazette
Extraordinary</i>, September 16, 1808. The question is not alluded to in
the <i>Weekly Political Register</i> of September 17, but on the 24th Cobbett
opened fire with a long article (pp. 481-502) headed, "Conventions in
Portugal," which was followed up by articles on the same subject in the
four succeeding issues. Articles iii., iv., v., vi., of the "Definitive
Convention" provided for the restoration of the French troops and their
safe convoy to France, with their artillery, equipments, and cavalry.
"Did the men," asks Cobbett (September 24), "who made this promise beat
the Duke d'Abrant&eacute;s [Junot], or were they like curs, who, having felt
the bite of the mastiff, lose all confidence in their number, and,
though they bark victory, suffer him to retire in quiet, carrying off
his bone to be disposed of at his leisure? No, not so; for they
complaisantly carry the bone for him." The rest of the article is
written in a similar strain.]

approached the English with certain proposals from Junot, which a week
later were formulated by the so-called Convention of Cintra, to which
Kellerman and Wellesley affixed their names. When the news reached
England that Napoleon's forces had been repulsed with loss, and yet the
French had been granted a safe exit from Portugal, the generals were
assailed with loud and indiscriminate censure. Burrard's interference
with Wellesley's plans was no doubt ill-judged and ill-timed; but the
opportunity of pursuit having been let slip, the acceptance of Junot's
terms was at once politic and inevitable. A court of inquiry, which was
held in London in January, 1809, upheld both the armistice of August 22
and the Convention; but neither Dalrymple nor Burrard ever obtained a
second command, and it was not until Talavera (July 28, 1809) had
effaced the memories of Cintra that Wellesley was reinstated in popular
favour.]</p></div>

Maria I. (b. 1734), who married her uncle, Pedro III., reigned with him
1777-86, and, as sole monarch, from 1786 to 1816. The death of her
husband, of her favourite confessor, Ignatio de San Caetano, who had
been raised by Pombal from the humblest rank to the position of
archbishop <i>in partibus</i>, and of her son, turned her brain, and she
became melancholy mad. She was only queen in name after 1791, and in
1799 her son, Maria Jos&eacute; Luis, was appointed regent. Beckford saw her in
1787, and was impressed by her dignified bearing. "Justice and
clemency," he writes, "the motto so glaringly misapplied on the banner
of the abhorred Inquisition, might be transferred, with the strictest
truth, to this good princess" (<i>Italy, with Sketches of Spain and
Portugal</i>, 1834, p. 256). Ten years later, Southey, in his <i>Letters from
Spain</i>, 1797, p. 541, ascribes the "gloom" of the court of Lisbon to
"the dreadful malady of the queen." When the Portuguese royal family
were about to embark for Brazil in November, 1807, the queen was once
more seen in public after an interval of sixteen years. "She had to wait
some while upon the quay for the chair in which she was to be carried to
the boat, and her countenance, in which the insensibility of madness was
only disturbed by wonder, formed a striking contrast to the grief which
appeared in every other face" (Southey's <i>History of the Peninsular
War</i>, i. 110).]</p></div>

Byron had originally intended to introduce "variations" in his poem of a

authorities for these humorous episodes. The stanzas on the Convention
of Cintra (stanzas xxv.-xxviii. of the MS.), and the four stanzas on Sir
John Carr; the concluding stanzas of the MS., which were written in this
lighter vein, were suppressed at the instance of Dallas, or Murray, or
Gifford. From a passage in a letter to Dallas (August 21, 1811), it
appears that Byron had almost made up his mind to leave out "the two
stanzas of a buffooning cast on London's Sunday" (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i.
335). But, possibly, owing to their freedom from any compromising
personalities, or because wiser counsels prevailed, they were allowed to

placing the pole upright on the ground near the person to be sworn, who
is requested to take off his hat," etc. The oath, or rather a small part

classes: the <i>chulos</i> or footmen, the <i>banderilleros</i> or dart-throwers,
the <i>picadores</i> or horsemen, the <i>matadores</i> or <i>espadas</i> the
executioners. Each bull-fight, which lasts about twenty minutes, is
divided into three stages or acts. In the first act the <i>picadores</i>
receive the charge of the bull, defending themselves, but not, as a
rule, attacking the foe with their lances or <i>garrochas</i>. In the second
act the <i>chulos</i>, who are not mounted, wave coloured cloaks or
handkerchiefs in the bull's face, and endeavour to divert his fury from
the <i>picadores</i>, in case they have been thrown or worsted in the
encounter. At the same time, the <i>banderilleros</i> are at pains to implant
in either side of the bull's neck a number of barbed darts ornamented
with cut paper, and, sometimes, charged with detonating powder. It is
<i>de rigeur</i> to plant the barbs exactly on either side. In the third and
final act, the protagonist, the <i>matador</i> or <i>espada</i>, is the sole
performer. His function is to entice the bull towards him by waving the
<i>muleta</i> or red flag, and, standing in front of the animal, to inflict
the death-wound by plunging his sword between the left shoulder and the
blade. "The teams of mules now enter, glittering with flags and tinkling
with bells, whose gay decorations contrast with the stern cruelty and
blood; the dead bull is carried off at a rapid gallop, which always
delights the populace."&mdash;<i>Handbook for Spain</i>, by Richard Ford, 1898, i.

predestined to evil is to be traced to the Calvinistic teaching of his
boyhood (compare <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto III. stanza lxx. lines 8, 9; and
Canto IV. stanza xxxiv. line 6). Lady Byron regarded this creed of
despair as the secret of her husband's character, and the source of his
aberrations. In a letter to H. C. Robinson, March 5, 1855, she writes,
"Not merely from casual expressions, but from the whole tenour of Lord
Byron's feelings, I could not but conclude he was a believer in the
inspiration of the Bible, and had the gloomiest Calvinistic tenets. To
that unhappy view of the relation of the creature to the Creator, I have
always ascribed the misery of his life.... Instead of being made happier
by any apparent good, he felt convinced that every blessing would be
'turned into a curse' to him. Who, possessed by such ideas, could lead a
life of love and service to God or man? They must in a measure realize
themselves. 'The worst of it is, I <i>do</i> believe,' he said. I, like all
connected with him, was broken against the rock of predestination."]</p></div>

Smith), whom he had recently (January 16) declared <i>emerita</i> to the tune

Demetrius, set out for the Negroponte. "Lord Byron was unexpectedly

<p>It is a well-known fact that in the year 1809, the assassinations
in the streets of Lisbon and its vicinity were not
confined by the Portuguese to their countrymen; but that
Englishmen were daily butchered: and so far from redress
being obtained, we were requested not to interfere if we
perceived any compatriot defending himself against his allies.
I was once stopped in the way to the theatre at eight o'clock
in the evening, when the streets were not more empty than
they generally are at that hour, opposite to an open shop,
and in a carriage with a friend: had we not fortunately been
armed, I have not the least doubt that we should have
"adorned a tale" instead of telling one. The crime of
assassination is not confined to Portugal; in Sicily and
Malta we are knocked on the head at a handsome average
nightly, and not a Sicilian or Maltese is ever punished!</p>

It would be pleasant to learn who will subscribe for us, in or

men, first to be decimated in the capital, and then decimated
again (in the Irish fashion, <i>nine</i> out of <i>ten</i>),
in the 'bed of honour;' which, as Serjeant Kite says
[in Farquhar's <i>Recruiting Officer</i>, act i. sc. 1],
is considerably larger and more
commodious than 'the bed of Ware.' Then they must have

and generously
bestow the profits of the well and widely printed quarto, to
rebuild the 'Backwynd' and the 'Canongate,' or furnish new
kilts for the half-roasted Highlanders. Lord Wellington,
however, has enacted marvels; and so did his Oriental
brother, whom I saw charioteering over the French flag, and

out of this 'best of all possible worlds' [Pangloss, in <i>Candide</i>].
Sorely were we puzzled how to dispose of that same victory
of Talavera; and a victory it surely was somewhere, for
everybody claimed it. The Spanish despatch and mob
called it Cuesta's, and made no great mention of the Viscount;
the French called it <i>theirs</i>[1] (to my great discomfiture,&mdash;for a

<p>"Viv&#257; el Rey Fernando!" Long live King Ferdinand!
is the chorus of most of the Spanish patriotic songs. They
are chiefly in dispraise of the old King Charles, the Queen,
and the Prince of Peace. I have heard many of them:
some of the airs are beautiful. Godoy, the <i>Principe de la Paz</i>,
of an ancient but decayed family, was born at Badajoz,
on the frontiers of Portugal, and was originally in the ranks
of the Spanish guards; till his person attracted the queen's
eyes, and raised him to the dukedom of Alcudia, etc., etc.
It is to this man that the Spaniards universally impute the
ruin of their country.</p>

<p>[Manuel de Godoy (1767-1851) received the title of
<i>Principe de la Paz</i>, Prince of the Peace, in 1795, after the
Treaty of Basle, which ceded more than half St. Domingo
to France. His tenure of power, as prime minister and
director of the king's policy, coincided with the downfall of
Spanish power, and before the commencement of the
Peninsular War he was associated in the minds of the
people with national corruption and national degradation.
He was, moreover, directly instrumental in the betrayal of
Spain to France. By the Treaty of Fontainebleau, October
27, 1807, Portugal was to be divided between the King of
Etruria and Godoy as Prince of the Algarves, Portuguese
America was to fall to the King of Spain, and to bring this
about Napoleon's troops were to enter Spain and march
directly to Lisbon. The sole outcome of the treaty was the
occupation of Portugal and subsequent invasion of Spain.
Before Byron had begun his pilgrimage, Godoy's public
career had come to an end. During the insurrection at
Aranjuez, March 17-19, 1808, when Charles IV. abdicated
in favour of his son Ferdinand VII., Godoy was only preserved
from the fury of the populace by a timely imprisonment.
In the following May, by which time Ferdinand
himself was a prisoner in France, he was released at the
instance of Murat, and ordered to accompany Charles to
Bayonne, for the express purpose of cajoling his master into
a second abdication in favour of Napoleon. The remainder
of his long life was passed, first at Rome, and afterwards at
Paris, in exile and dependence. The execration of Godoy,
"who was really a mild, good-natured man," must, in
Napier's judgment, be attributed to Spanish venom and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Spanish prejudice. The betrayal of Spain was, he thinks,
the outcome of Ferdinand's intrigues no less than of Godoy's
unpatriotic ambition. Another and perhaps truer explanation
of popular odium is to be found in his supposed atheism
and well-known indifference to the rites of the Church, which
many years before had attracted the attention of the Holy
Office. The peasants cursed Godoy because the priests
triumphed over his downfall
(Napier's <i>History of the War in the Peninsula</i>, i. 8;
Southey's <i>Peninsular War</i>, i. 85

<p>Such were the exploits of the Maid of Saragoza, who by
her valour elevated herself to the highest rank of heroines.
When the author was at Seville, she walked daily on the
Prado, decorated with medals and orders, by command of the Junta.</p>

<p>[The story, as told by Southey (who seems to have
derived his information from
<i>The Narrative of the Siege of Zaragoza</i>,
by Charles Richard Vaughan, M.B., 1809), is
that "Augustina Zaragoza (<i>sic</i>), a handsome woman of the
lower class, about twenty-two years of age," a vivandiere,
in the course of her rounds came with provisions to a battery
near the Portello gate. The gunners had all been killed,
and, as the citizens held back, "Augustina sprang over the
dead and dying, snatched a match from the hand of a dead
artilleryman, and fired off a twenty-six pounder; then,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
jumping upon the gun, made a solemn vow never to quit it
alive during the siege."</p>

<p>After the retreat of the French, "a pension was settled
upon Augustina, and the daily pay of an artilleryman. She
was also to wear a small shield of honour, embroidered upon
the sleeve of her gown, with 'Zaragoza' inscribed upon it"
(Southey's <i>Peninsular War</i>, ii. 14, 34).</p>

<p>Napier, "neither wholly believing nor absolutely denying
these exploits," which he does not condescend to give in
detail, remarks "that for a long time afterwards, Spain
swarmed with Zaragoza heroines, clothed in half-uniforms,
and theatrically loaded with weapons."</p>

<p>A picture of "The Defence of Saragossa," painted by Sir
David Wilkie, which contained her portrait, was exhibited
in the Royal Academy in 1829, and was purchased by the
king (Napier's <i>History of the War in the Peninsula</i>, i. 45;
<i>Life of Sir D. Wilkie</i>, by John W. Mollett, 1881, p. 83).

<p>Alluding to the conduct and death of Solano, the governor
of Cadiz, in May, 1808.</p>

<p>[The Marquis of Solano, commander-in-chief of the forces
at Cadiz, was murdered by the populace. The "Supreme Junta"
of Seville had directed him to attack the French fleet
anchored off Cadiz, and Admiral Purvis, acting in concert
with General Spencer, had offered to co-operate, but Solano
was unwilling to take his orders "from a self-constituted
authority, and hesitated to commit his country in war with
a power whose strength he knew better than the temper of
his countrymen." "His abilities, courage, and unblemished
character have never been denied."&mdash;Napier's
<i>War in the Peninsula</i>, i. 20, 21.]</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"War to the knife." Palafox's answer to the French
general at the siege of Saragoza.</p>

<p>[Towards the close of the first siege of Zaragoza,
August 5, 1808, Marshal Lefebvre (1755-1820), under the
impression that the city had fallen into his hands,
"required Palafox to surrender in these words:
'Quartel-general, Santa Engracia. La Capitulation!'
['Head-quarters, St. Engracia. Capitulation'].
The reply was,
'Quartel-general, Zaragoza. Guerra al cuchillo'
['Head-quarters, Zaragoza. War at the knife's point']."
Subsequently, December, 1808, when Moncey (1754-1842) again called
upon him to surrender, he appealed to the people of Madrid.
"The dogs," he said, "by whom he was beset scarcely left
him time to clean his sword from their blood; but they still
found their grave at Zaragoza." Southey notes that "all
Palafox's proclamations had the high tone and something
of the inflection of Spanish romance, suiting the character
of those to whom it was directed" (<i>Peninsular War</i>, ii. 25;
iii. 152; <i>Narrative of the Siege</i>, by C. R. Vaughan, 1809,
pp. 22, 23). Napier, whose account of the first siege of
Zaragoza is based on Caballero's
<i>Victoires et Conqu&egrave;tes des Fran&ccedil;ais</i>,
and on the <i>Journal of Lefebvre's Operations</i>
(MSS.), does not record these romantic incidents. He
attributes the raising of the siege to the "bad discipline
of the French, and the system of terror established by the
Spanish leaders." The inspirers and proclaimers of "war
even to the knife" were, he maintains, <i>Tio</i> or Goodman
Jorge (Jorge Ibort) and Tio Murin, and not Palafox, who
was ignorant of war, and who, on more than one occasion,
was careful to provide for his own safety (<i>History of the
War in the Peninsula</i>, i. 41-46).]</p>

<p>I should have ventured a verse to the memory of the late
Charles Skinner Matthews, Fellow of Downing College,
Cambridge, were he not too much above all praise of mine.
His powers of mind, shown in the attainment of greater
honours, against the ablest candidates, than those of any
graduate on record at Cambridge, have sufficiently established
his fame on the spot where it was acquired; while his
softer qualities live in the recollection of friends who loved
him too well to envy his superiority. [To an objection made
by Dallas to this note, Byron replied, "I was so sincere in
my note on the late Charles Matthews, and do feel myself so
totally unable to do justice to his talents, that the passage
must stand for the very reason you bring against it. To
him all the men I ever knew were pigmies. He was an
intellectual giant. It is true I loved Wingfield better; he
was the earliest and the dearest, and one of the few one
could never repent of having loved: but in ability&mdash;ah!
you did not know Matthews,!"&mdash;<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 8. [For

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note</span>.&mdash;The MS. closes with stanza xcii. Stanzas xciii.-xcviii. were
added after <i>Childe Harold</i> was in the press. Byron sent them to Dallas,
October 11, 1811, and, apparently, on the same day composed the <i>Epistle
to a Friend</i> (F. Hodgson) <i>in answer to some lines exhorting the Author
to be cheerful, and to "Banish Care,"</i> and the first poem <i>To Thyrza</i>
("Without a stone to mark the Spot"). "I have sent," he writes, "two or
three additional stanzas for both '<i>Fyttes</i>.' I have been again shocked
with a <i>death</i>, and have lost one very dear to me in happier times; but
'I have almost forgot the taste of grief,' and 'supped full of horrors'
till I have become callous, nor have I a tear left for an event which,
five years ago, would have bowed down my head to the earth. It seems as
though I were to experience in my youth the greatest misery of age. My
friends fall around me, and I shall be left a lonely tree before I am
withered." In one respect he would no longer disclaim identity with
Childe Harold. "Death had deprived him of his nearest connections." He
had seen his friends "around him fall like leaves in wintry weather." He
felt "like one deserted;" and in the "dusky shadow" of that early
desolation he was destined to walk till his life's end. It is not
without cause when "a man of great spirit grows melancholy."</p>

<p>In connection with this subject, it may be noted that lines 6 and 7 of
stanza xcv. do not bear out Byron's contention to Dallas (<i>Letters</i>,
October 14 and 31, 1811), that in these three <i>in memoriam</i> stanzas
(ix., xcv., xcvi.) he is bewailing an event which took place <i>after</i> he
returned to Newstead. The "more than friend" had "ceased to be" before
the "wanderer" returned. It is evident that Byron did not take Dallas
into his confidence.]</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

the Second Canto of the Pilgrimage. The general meaning is clear enough,
but the unities are disregarded. The scene shifts more than once, and
there is a moral within a moral. The poet begins by invoking Athena
(Byron wrote Athen&aelig;) to look down on the ruins of "her holy and
beautiful house," and bewails her unreturning heroes of the sword and
pen. He then summons an Oriental, a "Son of the Morning," Moslem or
"light Greek," possibly a <i>Canis venaticus</i>, the discoverer or vendor of
a sepulchral urn, and, with an adjuration to spare the sacred relic,
points to the Acropolis, the cemetery of dead divinities, and then once
more to the urn at his feet. "'Vanity of vanities&mdash;all is vanity!' Gods
and men may come and go, but Death 'goes on for ever.'" The scene
changes, and he feigns to be present at the rifling of a barrow, the
"tomb of the Athenian heroes" on the plain of Marathon, or one of the
lonely tumuli on Sigeum and Rhoeteum, "the great and goodly tombs" of
Achilles and Patroclus ("they twain in one golden urn"); of Antilochus,
and of Telamonian Ajax. Marathon he had already visited, and marked "the
perpendicular cut" which at Fauvel's instigation had been recently
driven into the large barrow; and he had, perhaps, read of the real or
pretended excavation by Signor Ghormezano (1787) of a tumulus at the
Sigean promontory. The "mind's eye," which had conjured up "the
shattered heaps," images a skull of one who "kept the world in awe,"
and, after moralizing in Hamlet's vein on the humorous catastrophe of
decay, the poet concludes with the Preacher "that there is no work, nor
device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave." After this profession
of unfaith, before he returns to Harold and his pilgrimage, he takes up
his parable and curses Elgin and all his works. The passage as a whole
suggests the essential difference between painting and poetry. As a
composition, it recalls the frontispiece of a seventeenth-century
classic. The pictured scene, with its superfluity of accessories, is
grotesque enough; but the poetic scenery, inconsequent and yet vivid as
a dream, awakens, and fulfills the imagination. (<i>Travels in Albania</i>,

The expunged lines (see <a href="#Footnote_DV"><i>var.</i> i.</a>) carried the Lucretian tenets of the
preceding stanza to their logical conclusion. The end is silence, not a
reunion with superior souls. But Dallas objected; and it may well be
that, in the presence of death, Byron could not "guard his unbelief," or
refrain from a renewed questioning of the "Grand Perhaps." Stanza for
stanza, the new version is an improvement on the original. (See

dated October 14, 1811, and was careful to add, "I think it proper to
state to you, that this stanza alludes to an event which has taken place
since my arrival here, and not to the death of any <i>male</i> friend"
(<i>Letters</i>. 1898, ii. 57). The reference is not to Edleston, as Dallas
might have guessed, and as Wright (see <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1891, p. 17)
believed. Again, in a letter to Dallas, dated October 31, 1811 (<i>ibid</i>.,
ii. 65), he sends "a few stanzas," presumably the lines "To Thyrza,"
which are dated October 31, 1811, and says that "they refer to the death
of one to whose name you are a <i>stranger</i>, and, consequently, cannot be
interested (<i>sic</i>) ... They relate to the same person whom I have
mentioned in Canto 2nd, and at the conclusion of the poem." It follows
from this second statement that we have Byron's authority for connecting
stanza ix. with stanzas xcv., xcvi., and, inferentially, his authority
for connecting stanzas ix., xcv., xcvi. with the group of "Thyrza"
poems. And there our knowledge ends. We must leave the mystery where
Byron willed that it should be left. "All that we know is, nothing can
be known."]</p></div>

<a id="ea_A">[A]</a> [William Richard Hamilton (1777-1859) was the son of Anthony
Hamilton, Archdeacon of Colchester, etc., and grandson of Richard
Terrick, Bishop of London. In 1799, when Lord Elgin was appointed
Ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Hamilton accompanied him as private
secretary. After the battle of Ramassieh (Alexandria, March 20, 1801),
and the subsequent evacuation of Egypt by the French (August 30, 1801),
Hamilton, who had been sent on a diplomatic mission, was successful in
recapturing the Rosetta Stone, which, in violation of a specified
agreement, had been placed on board a French man-of-war. He was
afterwards employed by Elgin as agent plenipotentiary in the purchase,
removal, and deportation of marbles. He held office (1809-22) as
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and as Minister at the Court of
Naples (1822-25). From 1838 to 1858 he was a Trustee of the British
Museum. He published, in 1809, <i>&AElig;gyptiaca, or Some Account of the
Ancient and Modern State of Egypt</i>; and, in 1811, his <i>Memorandum on the
Subject of the Earl of Elgin's Pursuits in Greece</i>. (For Hamilton, see

volume of proof-sheets entitled "Additions to Childe Harold," It was
first published in the seventh edition, 1814. It may be taken for
granted that Byron had seen what he describes. There is, however, no
record of any visit to Mount Athos, either in his letters from the East
or in Hobhouse's journals.
</p><p>
The actual mount, "the giant height [6350 feet], rears itself in
solitary magnificence, an insulated cone of white limestone." "When it
is seen from a distance, the peninsula [of which the southern portion
rises to a height of 2000 feet] is below the horizon, and the peak rises
quite solitary from the sea." Of this effect Byron may have had actual
experience; but Hobhouse, in describing the prospect from Cape
Janissary, is careful to record that "Athos itself is said to be
sometimes visible in the utmost distance (circ. 90 miles), but it was
not discernible during our stay on the spot." (Murray's <i>Handbook for
Greece</i>, p. 843; <i>Childe Harold</i>, edited by H. F. Tozer, p. 233;

mean "whom the young love to talk of, and the wise to follow as an

"extension of commerce and civilization" which followed his victories.
But, surely, the antithesis lies between Alexander the ideal of the
young, and Alexander the deterrent example of the old. The phrase,

<i>Spider</i> on Tuesday, September 19, 1809 (Byron, in a letter to his
mother, November 12, says September 21), and anchored off Patras on the
night of Sunday, the 24th. On Tuesday, the 26th, they were under way at
12 noon, and on the evening of that day they saw the sun set over
Mesalonghi. The next morning, September 27, they were in the channel
between Ithaca and the mainland, with Ithaca, then in the hands of the
French, to the left. "We were close to it," says Hobhouse, "and saw a
few shrubs on a brown heathy land, two little towns in the hills
scattered among trees." The travellers made "but little progress this
day," and, apparently, having redoubled Cape St. Andreas, the southern
extremity of Ithaca, they sailed (September 28) through the channel
between Ithaca and Cephalonia, passed the hill of &AElig;tos, on which stood
the so-called "Castle of Ulysses," whence Penelope may have "overlooked
the wave," and caught sight of "the Lover's refuge" in the distance.
Towards the close of the same day they doubled Cape Ducato ("Leucadia's
cape," the scene of Sappho's leap), and, sailing under "the ancient
mount," the site of the Temple of Apollo, anchored off Prevesa at seven
in the evening. Poetry and prose are not always in accord. If, as Byron
says, it was "an autumn's eve" when they hailed "Leucadia's cape afar,"
if the evening star shone over the rock when they approached it, they
must have sailed fast to reach Prevesa, some thirty miles to the north,
by seven o'clock. But <i>de minimis</i>, the Muse is as disregardful as the
Law. And, perhaps, after all, it was Hobhouse who misread his log-book.

there is no heaven, no immortality, for the sons of men. But what

reached Prevesa November 7. At midday November 9 they set sail for
Patras in a galliot of Ali's, "a vessel of about fifty tons burden, with
three short masts and a large lateen sail." Instead of doubling Cape
Ducato, they were driven out to sea northward, and, finally, at one
o'clock in the morning, anchored off the Port of Phanari on the Suliote
coast. Towards the evening of the next day (November 10) they landed in
"the marshy bay" (stanza lxviii. line 2) and rode to Volondorako, where
they slept. "Here they were well received by the Albanian primate of the
place and by the Vizier's soldiers quartered there." Instead of
re-embarking in the galliot, they returned to Prevesa by land (November
11). As the country to the north of the Gulf of Arta was up in arms, and
bodies of robbers were abroad, they procured an escort of thirty-seven
Albanians, hired another galliot, and on Monday, the 13th, sailed across
the entrance of the gulf as far as the fortress of Vonitsa, where they
anchored for the night. By four o'clock in the afternoon of November 14
they reached Utraikey or Lutraki, "situated in a deep bay surrounded
with rocks at the south-east corner of the Gulf of Arta." The courtyard
of a barrack on the shore is the scene of the song and dance (stanzas

<p><span class="smcap">Part</span> of the Acropolis was destroyed by the explosion of
a magazine during the Venetian siege.</p>

<p>[In 1684, when the Venetian Armada threatened Athens,
the Turks removed the Temple of Victory, and made use
of the materials for the construction of a bastion. In the
autumn of 1687, when the city was besieged by the Venetians
under Francesco Morosini (1618-1694; Doge of Venice, 1688),
"mortars were planted ... near the north-east corner of the
rock, which threw their shells at a high angle, with a low charge,
into the Acropolis.... On the 25th of September, a Venetian
bomb blew up a small powder-magazine in the Propyl&aelig;a,
and on the following evening another fell in the Parthenon,
where the Turks had deposited ... a considerable quantity
of powder.... A terrific explosion took place; the central
columns of the peristyle, the walls of the cella, and the
immense architraves and cornices they supported, were
scattered around the remains of the temple. The Propyl&aelig;a
had been partly destroyed in 1656 by the explosion of a
magazine which was struck by lightning."&mdash;Finlay's <i>History

<p>We can all feel, or imagine, the regret with which the
ruins of cities, once the capitals of empires, are beheld: the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
reflections suggested by such objects are too trite to require
recapitulation. But never did the littleness of man, and the
vanity of his very best virtues, of patriotism to exalt, and of
valour to defend his country appear more conspicuous than
in the record of what Athens was, and the certainty of what
she now is. This theatre of contention between mighty
factions, of the struggles of orators, the exaltation and
deposition of tyrants, the triumph and punishment of generals,
is now become a scene of petty intrigue and perpetual disturbance,
between the bickering agents of certain British
nobility and gentry. "The wild foxes, the owls and serpents
in the ruins of Babylon,"<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> were surely less degrading than
such inhabitants. The Turks have the plea of conquest
for their tyranny, and the Greeks have only suffered the
fortune of war, incidental to the bravest; but how are the
mighty fallen, when two painters<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> contest the privilege of
plundering the Parthenon, and triumph in turn, according
to the tenor of each succeeding firman! Sylla could but
punish, Philip subdue, and Xerxes burn Athens; but it
remained for the paltry antiquarian, and his despicable
agents, to render her contemptible as himself and his pursuits.
The Parthenon, before its destruction, in part, by fire during
the Venetian siege, had been a temple, a church, and a
mosque.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> In each point of view it is an object of regard:

<p>It was not always the custom of the Greeks to burn
their dead; the greater Ajax, in particular, was interred
entire. Almost all the chiefs became gods after their decease;
and he was indeed neglected, who had not annual games
near his tomb, or festivals in honour of his memory by his
countrymen, as Achilles, Brasidas, etc., and at last even
Antinous, whose death was as heroic as his life was infamous.</p>

<p>[The Olympieion, or Temple of Zeus Olympius, on the
south-east of the Acropolis, some five hundred yards from
the foot of the rock, was begun by Pisistratos, and completed
seven hundred years later by Hadrian. It was one of the
three or four largest temples of antiquity. The cella had
been originally enclosed by a double row of twenty columns
at the sides, and a triple row of eight columns at each front,
making a hundred and four columns in all; but in 1810 only
sixteen "lofty Corinthian columns" were standing. Mr.
Tozer points out that "'base' is accurate, because Corinthian
columns have bases, which Doric columns have not," and
notes that the word "'unshaken' implies that the column
itself had fallen, but the base remains."&mdash;<i>Childe Harold</i>,

<p>At this moment (January 3, 1810), besides what has been
already deposited in London, an Hydriot vessel is in the
Pyr&aelig;us to receive every portable relic. Thus, as I heard a
young Greek observe, in common with many of his countrymen&mdash;for,
lost as they are, they yet feel on this occasion&mdash;thus
may Lord Elgin boast of having ruined Athens. An
Italian painter of the first eminence, named Lusieri<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>,
is the
agent of devastation; and like the Greek <i>finder</i><a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
of Verres in
Sicily, who followed the same profession, he has proved the
able instrument of plunder. Between this artist and the
French Consul Fauvel<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>,
who wishes to rescue the remains
for his own government, there is now a violent dispute concerning
a car employed in their conveyance, the wheel of
which&mdash;I wish they were both broken upon it!&mdash;has been
locked up by the Consul, and Lusieri has laid his complaint
before the Waywode. Lord Elgin has been extremely
happy in his choice of Signer Lusieri. During a residence
of ten years in Athens, he never had the curiosity to proceed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as far as Sunium (now Cape Colonna),<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> till he accompanied
us in our second excursion. However, his works, as far as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
they go, are most beautiful: but they are almost all unfinished.
While he and his patrons confine themselves to tasting
medals, appreciating cameos, sketching columns, and cheapening
gems, their little absurdities are as harmless as insect or
fox-hunting, maiden-speechifying, barouche-driving, or any
such pastime; but when they carry away three or four shiploads
of the most valuable and massy relics that time and
barbarism have left to the most injured and most celebrated
of cities: when they destroy, in a vain attempt to tear down,
those works which have been the admiration of ages, I know
no motive which can excuse, no name which can designate,
the perpetrators of this dastardly devastation. It was not
the least of the crimes laid to the charge of Verres, that he
had plundered Sicily, in the manner since imitated at Athens.
The most unblushing impudence could hardly go farther
than to affix the name of its plunderer to the walls of the
Acropolis; while the wanton and useless defacement of the
whole range of the basso-relievos, in one compartment of
the temple, will never permit that name to be pronounced
by an observer without execration.</p>

<p>On this occasion I speak impartially: I am not a collector
or admirer of collections, consequently no rival; but I have
some early prepossession in favour of Greece, and do not
think the honour of England advanced by plunder, whether
of India or Attica.</p>

<p>Another noble Lord [Aberdeen] has done better, because
he has done less: but some others, more or less noble, yet
"all honourable men," have done <i>best</i>, because, after a deal
of excavation and execration, bribery to the Waywode,
mining and countermining, they have done nothing at all.

<p>I cannot resist availing myself of the permission of my
friend Dr. Clarke, whose name requires no comment with
the public, but whose sanction will add tenfold weight to my
testimony, to insert the following extract from a very obliging
letter of his to me, as a note to the above lines:&mdash;"When the
last of the Metopes was taken from the Parthenon, and, in
moving of it, great part of the superstructure with one of the
triglyphs was thrown down by the workmen whom Lord
Elgin employed, the Disdar, who beheld the mischief done
to the building, took his pipe from his mouth, dropped a
tear, and in a supplicating tone of voice, said to Lusieri,
<span title="Telos">&#932;&#8051;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>!&mdash;I was present."
The Disdar alluded to was the father of the present Disdar.</p>

castle or fort (<i>N. Eng. Dict</i>., art. "Dizdar").

<p class="attrib"><a href="#CII_XXXVIII">Stanza xxxviii.</a> lines 5 and 6.</p>

<p>Albania comprises part of Macedonia, Illyria, Chaonia,
and Epirus. Iskander is the Turkish word for Alexander;
and the celebrated Scanderbeg<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
(Lord Alexander) is alluded
to in the third and fourth lines of the thirty-eighth stanza. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
do not know whether I am correct in making Scanderbeg
the countryman of Alexander, who was born at Pella in
Macedon, but Mr. Gibbon terms him so, and adds Pyrrhus
to the list, in speaking of his exploits.</p>

<p>Of Albania Gibbon remarks that a country "within sight
of Italy is less known than the interior of America." Circumstances,
of little consequence to mention, led Mr. Hobhouse
and myself into that country before we visited any
other part of the Ottoman dominions; and with the exception
of Major Leake,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
then officially resident at Joannina,
no other Englishmen have ever advanced beyond the capital
into the interior, as that gentleman very lately assured me.
Ali Pacha was at that time (October, 1809) carrying on war
against Ibrahim Pacha, whom he had driven to Berat, a
strong fortress, which he was then besieging: on our arrival
at Joannina we were invited to Tepaleni, his highness's
birthplace, and favourite Serai, only one day's distance from
Berat; at this juncture the Vizier had made it his headquarters.
After some stay in the capital, we accordingly
followed; but though furnished with every accommodation,
and escorted by one of the Vizier's secretaries, we were nine
days (on account of the rains) in accomplishing a journey
which, on our return, barely occupied four. On our route we
passed two cities, Argyrocastro and Libochabo, apparently
little inferior to Yanina in size; and no pencil or pen can
ever do justice to the scenery in the vicinity of Zitza and
Delvinachi, the frontier village of Epirus and Albania Proper.</p>

<p>On Albania and its inhabitants I am unwilling to descant,
because this will be done so much better by my fellow-traveller,
in a work which may probably precede this in publication,
that I as little wish to follow as I would to anticipate
him.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
But some few observations are necessary to the text.
The Arnaouts, or Albanese, struck me forcibly by their
resemblance to the Highlanders of Scotland, in dress, figure,
and manner of living. Their very mountains seemed Caledonian,
with a kinder climate. The kilt, though white; the
spare, active form; their dialect, Celtic in its sound; and
their hardy habits, all carried me back to Morven. No
nation are so detested and dreaded by their neighbours as
the Albanese; the Greeks hardly regard them as Christians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
or the Turks as Moslems; and in fact they are a mixture of
both, and sometimes neither. Their habits are predatory&mdash;all
are armed; and the red-shawled Arnaouts, the Montenegrins,
Chimariots, and Gegdes, are treacherous;<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
the others
differ somewhat in garb, and essentially in character. As
far as my own experience goes, I can speak favourably. I
was attended by two, an Infidel and a Mussulman, to Constantinople
and every other part of Turkey which came
within my observation; and more faithful in peril, or indefatigable
in service, are rarely to be found. The Infidel
was named Basilius; the Moslem, Dervish Tahiri; the former
a man of middle age, and the latter about my own. Basili
was strictly charged by Ali Pacha in person to attend us;
and Dervish was one of fifty who accompanied us through
the forests of Acarnania to the banks of Achelous, and
onward to Messalonghi in &AElig;tolia. There I took him into
my own service, and never had occasion to repent it till the
moment of my departure.</p>

<p>When, in 1810, after the departure of my friend Mr.
Hobhouse for England, I was seized with a severe fever in
the Morea, these men saved my life by frightening away my
physician, whose throat they threatened to cut if I was not
cured within a given time. To this consolatory assurance
of posthumous retribution, and a resolute refusal of Dr.
Romanelli's prescriptions, I attributed my recovery.<a name="FNanchor_GG" id="FNanchor_GG"></a><a href="#Footnote_GG" class="fnanchor">[gg]</a>
I had
left my last remaining English servant at Athens; my
dragoman was as ill as myself, and my poor Arnaouts nursed
me with an attention which would have done honour to
civilization. They had a variety of adventures; for the
Moslem, Dervish, being a remarkably handsome man, was
always squabbling with the husbands of Athens; insomuch
that four of the principal Turks paid me a visit of remonstrance
at the Convent on the subject of his having taken
a woman from the bath&mdash;whom he had lawfully bought, however&mdash;a
thing quite contrary to etiquette. Basili also was
extremely gallant amongst his own persuasion, and had the
greatest veneration for the church, mixed with the highest
contempt of churchmen, whom he cuffed upon occasion in
a most heterodox manner. Yet he never passed a church
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
without crossing himself; and I remember the risk he ran
in entering St. Sophia, in Stambol, because it had once been
a place of his worship. On remonstrating with him on his
inconsistent proceedings, he invariably answered, "Our
church is holy, our priests are thieves:" and then he crossed
himself as usual, and boxed the ears of the first "papas"
who refused to assist in any required operation, as was
always found to be necessary where a priest had any influence
with the Cogia Bashi<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
of his village. Indeed, a more
abandoned race of miscreants cannot exist than the lower
orders of the Greek clergy.</p>

<p>When preparations were made for my return, my Albanians
were summoned to receive their pay. Basili took his with
an awkward show of regret at my intended departure, and
marched away to his quarters with his bag of piastres. I
sent for Dervish, but for some time he was not to be found;
at last he entered, just as Signor Logotheti,<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
father to the
ci-devant Anglo-consul of Athens, and some other of my
Greek acquaintances, paid me a visit. Dervish took the
money in his hand, but on a sudden dashed it to the ground;
and clasping his hands, which he raised to his forehead, rushed
out of the room weeping bitterly. From that moment to the
hour of my embarkation, he continued his lamentations, and
all our efforts to console him only produced this answer,
"<span title="M'apheinei">&#924;'&#945;&#966;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span>",
"He leaves me." Signer Logotheti, who never wept
before for anything less than the loss of a para (about the
fourth of a farthing), melted; the padre of the convent, my
attendants, my visitors&mdash;and I verily believe that even
Sterne's "foolish fat scullion" would have left her "fish-kettle"
to sympathize with the unaffected and unexpected
sorrow of this barbarian.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>


<p>For my own part, when I remembered that, a short time
before my departure from England, a noble and most intimate
associate had excused himself from taking leave of me
because he had to attend a female relation "to a milliner's,"<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
I felt no less surprised than humiliated by the present
occurrence and the past recollection. That Dervish would
leave me with some regret was to be expected; when master
and man have been scrambling over the mountains of a
dozen provinces together, they are unwilling to separate;
but his present feelings, contrasted with his native ferocity,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
improved my opinion of the human heart. I believe this
almost feudal fidelity is frequent amongst them. One day,
on our journey over Parnassus, an Englishman in my service
gave him a push in some dispute about the baggage, which
he unluckily mistook for a blow; he spoke not, but sat down
leaning his head upon his hands. Foreseeing the consequences,
we endeavoured to explain away the affront, which
produced the following answer:&mdash;"I <i>have been</i> a robber;
I <i>am</i> a soldier; no captain ever struck me;
<i>you</i> are my master, I have eaten your bread,
but by <i>that</i> bread! (a usual oath)
had it been otherwise, I would have stabbed the dog,
your servant, and gone to the mountains." So the affair ended,
but from that day forward he never thoroughly forgave the
thoughtless fellow who insulted him. Dervish excelled in the
dance of his country, conjectured to be a remnant of
the ancient Pyrrhic: be that as it may, it is manly, and
requires wonderful agility. It is very distinct from the
stupid Romaika,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
the dull round-about of the Greeks, of which
our Athenian party had so many specimens.</p>

<p>The Albanians in general (I do not mean the cultivators
of the earth in the provinces, who have also that appellation,
but the mountaineers) have a fine cast of countenance; and
the most beautiful women I ever beheld, in stature and in
features, we saw <i>levelling</i> the <i>road</i> broken down by the
torrents between Delvinachi and Libochabo. Their manner
of walking is truly theatrical; but this strut is probably the
effect of the capote, or cloak, depending from one shoulder.
Their long hair reminds you of the Spartans, and their
courage in desultory warfare is unquestionable. Though
they have some cavalry amongst the Gegdes, I never saw a
good Arnaout horseman; my own preferred the English
saddles, which, however, they could never keep. But on foot
they are not to be subdued by fatigue.</p>

legend, which he gives as a fact, perhaps gave birth to the
later and more poetical fiction. The Leucadians, he says,
once a year, on Apollo's day, were wont to hurl a criminal
from the rock into the sea by way of expiation and propitiation.
Birds of all kinds were attached to the victim to
break his fall, and, if he reached the sea uninjured, there was
a fleet of little boats ready to carry him to other shores.
It is possible that dim memories of human sacrifice lingered in
the islands, that in course of time victims were transformed
into "lovers," and it is certain that poets and commentators,
"prone to lie," are responsible for names and incidents.]</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Anciently Mount Tomarus.</p>

<p>["Mount Tomerit, or Tomohr," says Mr. Tozer, "lies
north-east of Tepalen, and therefore the sun could not set
behind it" (<i>Childe Harold</i>, 1885, p. 272).
But, writing to Drury, May 3, 1810, Byron says that
"he penetrated as far as Mount Tomarit."
Probably by "Tomarit" he does not
mean Mount Tomohr, which lies to the north-east of Berat,
but Mount Olytsika, ancient Tomaros
(<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Footnote_151">p. 132, note 1</a>),
which lies to the west of Janina, between the valley
of Tcharacovista and the sea. "Elle domine," writes M.
Carapanos, "toutes les autres montagnes qui l'entourent."
"Laos," Mr. Tozer thinks, "is a mere blunder for A&ouml;us, the
Viosa (or Voioussa), which joins the Derapuli a few miles
south of Tepaleni, and flows under the walls of the city"
(<i>Dodone et ses Ruines</i>, 1878, p. 8). (For the A&ouml;us and
approach to Tepeleni, see <i>Travels in Albania</i>, i. 91.)]</p>

the author and his fellow-traveller. In the summer it must

<p>The last stanza would puzzle a commentator: the men have certainly
buskins of the most beautiful texture, but the ladies (to whom the above
is supposed to be addressed) have nothing under their little yellow
boots and slippers but a well-turned and sometimes very white ankle. The
Arnaout girls are much handsomer than the Greeks, and their dress is far
more picturesque. They preserve their shape much longer also, from being
always in the open air. It is to be observed, that the Arnaout is not a
<i>written</i> language: the words of this song, therefore, as well as the
one which follows, are spelt according to their pronunciation. They are
copied by one who speaks and understands the dialect perfectly, and who
is a native of Athens.</p>

I will request Miss Owenson,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>
when she next borrows
an Athenian heroine for her four volumes, to have the goodness

Athens ever saw (except Lord E.), and the unworthy occupant
of the Acropolis, on a handsome annual stipend of 150
piastres (eight pounds sterling), out of which he has only to
pay his garrison, the most ill-regulated corps in the ill-regulated
Ottoman Empire. I speak it tenderly, seeing I
was once the cause of the husband of "Ida of Athens"
nearly suffering the bastinado; and because the said
"Disdar" is a turbulent husband, and beats his wife; so
that I exhort and beseech Miss Owenson to sue for a
separate maintenance in behalf of "Ida." Having premised
thus much, on a matter of such import to the readers of
romances, I may now leave Ida to mention her birthplace.</p>

<p>Setting aside the magic of the name, and all those associations
which it would be pedantic and superfluous to recapitulate,
the very situation of Athens would render it the
favourite of all who have eyes for art or nature. The climate,
to me at least, appeared a perpetual spring; during eight
months I never passed a day without being as many hours
on horseback: rain is extremely rare, snow never lies in the
plains, and a cloudy day is an agreeable rarity. In Spain,
Portugal, and every part of the East which I visited, except
Ionia and Attica, I perceived no such superiority of climate
to our own; and at Constantinople, where I passed May,
June, and part of July (1810), you might "damn the climate,
and complain of spleen," five days out of seven.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>


<p>The air of the Morea is heavy and unwholesome, but the
moment you pass the isthmus in the direction of Megara
the change is strikingly perceptible. But I fear Hesiod will

<p>We found at Livadia an "esprit fort" in a Greek bishop,
of all free-thinkers! This worthy hypocrite rallied his own
religion with great intrepidity (but not before his flock), and
talked of a mass as a "coglioneria."<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> It was impossible to
think better of him for this; but, for a Boeotian, he was
brisk with all his absurdity. This phenomenon (with the
exception indeed of Thebes, the remains of Ch&aelig;ronea, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
plain of Platea, Orchomenus, Livadia, and its nominal cave

any body who thinks it worth while may contradict him.
At Castri we drank of half a dozen streamlets, some not of
the purest, before we decided to our satisfaction which was
the true Castalian, and even that had a villanous twang,
probably from the snow, though it did not throw us into an

<p>From Fort Phyle, of which large remains still exist, the
plain of Athens, Pentelicus, Hymettus, the &AElig;gean, and the
Acropolis, burst upon the eye at once; in my opinion, a
more glorious prospect than even Cintra or Istambol. Not
the view from the Troad, with Ida, the Hellespont, and the
more distant Mount Athos, can equal it, though so superior in extent.</p>

<p>I heard much of the beauty of Arcadia, but excepting the
view from the Monastery of Megaspelion (which is inferior
to Zitza in a command of country), and the descent from the
mountains on the way from Tripolitza to Argos, Arcadia has
little to recommend it beyond the name.</p>

<p>Virgil could have put this into the mouth of none but an

Athenians are remarkable for their cunning; and the lower
orders are not improperly characterised in that proverb,
which classes them with the "Jews of Salonica, and the
Turks of the Negropont."</p>

<p>Among the various foreigners resident in Athens, French,
Italians, Germans, Ragusans, etc., there was never a difference
of opinion in their estimate of the Greek character,
though on all other topics they disputed with great acrimony.</p>

<p>M. Fauvel, the French Consul, who has passed thirty years
principally at Athens, and to whose talents as an artist, and
manners as a gentleman, none who have known him can
refuse their testimony, has frequently declared in my hearing,
that the Greeks do not deserve to be emancipated; reasoning
on the grounds of their "national and individual
depravity!" while he forgot that such depravity is to be
attributed to causes which can only be removed by the
measure he reprobates.</p>

<p>M. Roque,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
a French merchant of respectability long
settled in Athens, asserted with the most amusing gravity,
"Sir, they are the same <i>canaille</i> that existed
<i>in the days of Themistocles!</i>" an alarming remark to the
"Laudator temporis acti." The ancients banished Themistocles; the
moderns cheat Monsieur Roque; thus great men have ever
been treated!</p>

<p>In short, all the Franks who are fixtures, and most of the
Englishmen, Germans, Danes, etc., of passage, came over
by degrees to their opinion, on much the same grounds that
a Turk in England would condemn the nation by wholesale,
because he was wronged by his lacquey, and overcharged
by his washerwoman.</p>

<p>Certainly it was not a little staggering when the Sieurs
Fauvel and Lusieri, the two greatest demagogues of the day,
who divide between them the power of Pericles and the
popularity of Cleon, and puzzle the poor Waywode with
perpetual differences, agreed in the utter condemnation,
"nulla virtute redemptum" (Juvenal, lib. i. <i>Sat.</i> iv. line 2),
of the Greeks in general, and of the Athenians in particular.
For my own humble opinion, I am loth to hazard it, knowing
as I do, that there be now in MS. no less than five tours
of the first magnitude, and of the most threatening aspect,
all in typographical array, by persons of wit and honour,
and regular common-place books: but, if I may say this,
without offence, it seems to me rather hard to declare so
positively and pertinaciously, as almost everybody has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
declared, that the Greeks, because they are very bad, will
never be better.</p>

<p>Eton and Sonnini<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> have led us astray by their panegyrics
and projects; but, on the other hand, De Pauw and
Thornton<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> have debased the Greeks beyond their demerits.</p>


<p>The Greeks will never be independent; they will never
be sovereigns as heretofore, and God forbid they ever
should! but they may be subjects without being slaves.
Our colonies are not independent, but they are free and
industrious, and such may Greece be hereafter.</p>

<p>At present, like the Catholics of Ireland and the Jews
throughout the world, and such other cudgelled and heterodox
people, they suffer all the moral and physical ills that
can afflict humanity. Their life is a struggle against truth;
they are vicious in their own defence. They are so unused
to kindness, that when they occasionally meet with it they
look upon it with suspicion, as a dog often beaten snaps at
your fingers if you attempt to caress him. "They are
ungrateful, notoriously, abominably ungrateful!"&mdash;this is the
general cry. Now, in the name of Nemesis! for what are
they to be grateful? Where is the human being that ever
conferred a benefit on Greek or Greeks? They are to be
grateful to the Turks for their fetters, and to the Franks for
their broken promises and lying counsels. They are to be
grateful to the artist who engraves their ruins, and to the
antiquary who carries them away; to the traveller whose
janissary flogs them, and to the scribbler whose journal
abuses them. This is the amount of their obligations to
foreigners.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Franciscan Convent, Athens</span>, <i>January</i> 23, 1811.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the remnants of the barbarous policy of the
earlier ages, are the traces of bondage which yet exist in
different countries; whose inhabitants, however divided in
religion and manners, almost all agree in oppression.</p>

<p>The English have at last compassionated their negroes,
and under a less bigoted government, may probably one
day release their Catholic brethren; but the interposition
of foreigners alone can emancipate the Greeks, who, otherwise,
appear to have as small a chance of redemption from
the Turks, as the Jews have from mankind in general.</p>

<p>Of the ancient Greeks we know more than enough; at
least the younger men of Europe devote much of their time
to the study of the Greek writers and history, which would
be more usefully spent in mastering their own. Of the
moderns, we are perhaps more neglectful than they deserve;
and while every man of any pretensions to learning is tiring
out his youth, and often his age, in the study of the language
and of the harangues of the Athenian demagogues in favour
of freedom, the real or supposed descendants of these sturdy
republicans are left to the actual tyranny of their masters,
although a very slight effort is required to strike off their
chains.</p>

<p>To talk, as the Greeks themselves do, of their rising again
to their pristine superiority, would be ridiculous: as the rest
of the world must resume its barbarism, after reasserting
the sovereignty of Greece: but there seems to be no very
great obstacle, except in the apathy of the Franks, to their
becoming an useful dependency, or even a free state, with
a proper guarantee;&mdash;under correction, however, be it
spoken, for many and well-informed men doubt the practicability
even of this.</p>

<p>The Greeks have never lost their hope, though they are
now more divided in opinion on the subject of their probable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
deliverers. Religion recommends the Russians; but they
have twice been deceived and abandoned by that power, and
the dreadful lesson they received after the Muscovite desertion
in the Morea has never been forgotten. The French
they dislike; although the subjugation of the rest of Europe
will, probably, be attended by the deliverance of continental
Greece. The islanders look to the English for succour, as
they have very lately possessed themselves of the Ionian
republic, Corfu excepted.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
But whoever appear with arms
in their hands will be welcome; and when that day arrives,
Heaven have mercy on the Ottomans;
they cannot expect it from the Giaours.</p>

<p>But instead of considering what they have been, and
speculating on what they may be, let us look at them as they are.</p>

<p>And here it is impossible to reconcile the contrariety of
opinions: some, particularly the merchants, decrying the
Greeks in the strongest language; others, generally travellers,
turning periods in their eulogy, and publishing very curious
speculations grafted on their former state, which can have
no more effect on their present lot, than the existence of the
Incas on the future fortunes of Peru.</p>

<p>One very ingenious person terms them the "natural allies
of Englishmen;" another no less ingenious, will not allow
them to be the allies of anybody, and denies their very
descent from the ancients; a third, more ingenious than
either, builds a Greek empire on a Russian foundation, and
realises (on paper) all the chimeras of Catharine II. As to
the question of their descent, what can it import whether the
Mainotes<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
are the lineal Laconians or not? or the present
Athenians as indigenous as the bees of Hymettus, or as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
grasshoppers, to which they once likened themselves? What
Englishman cares if he be of a Danish, Saxon, Norman, or
Trojan blood? or who, except a Welshman, is afflicted with
a desire of being descended from Caractacus?</p>

<p>The poor Greeks do not so much abound in the good
things of this world, as to render even their claims to
antiquity an object of envy; it is very cruel, then, in Mr.
Thornton to disturb them in the possession of all that time
has left them; viz. their pedigree, of which they are the
more tenacious, as it is all they can call their own. It would
be worth while to publish together, and compare, the works
of Messrs. Thornton and De Pauw, Eton and Sonnini;
paradox on one side, and prejudice on the other. Mr.
Thornton conceives himself to have claims to public confidence
from a fourteen years' residence at Pera; perhaps
he may on the subject of the Turks, but this can give him
no more insight into the real state of Greece and her inhabitants,
than as many years spent in Wapping into that of the
Western Highlands.</p>

<p>The Greeks of Constantinople live in Fanal;<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
and if Mr.
Thornton did not oftener cross the Golden Horn than his
brother merchants are accustomed to do, I should place no
great reliance on his information. I actually heard one of
these gentlemen boast of their little general intercourse with
the city, and assert of himself, with an air of triumph, that he
had been but four times at Constantinople in as many years.</p>

<p>As to Mr. Thornton's voyages in the Black Sea with
Greek vessels, they gave him the same idea of Greece as a
cruise to Berwick in a Scotch smack would of Johnny Groat's
house. Upon what grounds then does he arrogate the right
of condemning by wholesale a body of men of whom he can
know little? It is rather a curious circumstance that Mr.
Thornton, who so lavishly dispraises Pouqueville on every
occasion of mentioning the Turks, has yet recourse to him
as authority on the Greeks, and terms him an impartial
observer. Now, Dr. Pouqueville is as little entitled to that
appellation as Mr. Thornton to confer it on him.</p>

<p>The fact is, we are deplorably in want of information on the
subject of the Greeks, and in particular their literature; nor
is there any probability of our being better acquainted, till
our intercourse becomes more intimate, or their independence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
confirmed. The relations of passing travellers are as little to
be depended on as the invectives of angry factors; but till
something more can be attained, we must be content with
the little to be acquired from similar sources.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>


<p>However defective these may be, they are preferable to
the parodoxes of men who have read superficially of the
ancients, and seen nothing of the moderns, such as De Pauw;
who, when he asserts that the British breed of
horses is ruined by Newmarket, and that the Spartans<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
cowards in the field,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
betrays an equal knowledge of English
horses and Spartan men. His "philosophical observations"
have a much better claim to the title of "poetical." It could
not be expected that he who so liberally condemns some of
the most celebrated institutions of the ancient, should have
mercy on the modern Greeks; and it fortunately happens,
that the absurdity of his hypothesis on their forefathers
refutes his sentence on themselves.</p>

<p>Let us trust, then, that, in spite of the prophecies of De
Pauw, and the doubts of Mr. Thornton, there is a reasonable
hope of the redemption of a race of men, who, whatever may
be the errors of their religion and policy, have been amply
punished by three centuries and a half of captivity.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Some time after my return from Constantinople to this
city I received the thirty-first number of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i><a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> as a great favour,
and certainly at this distance an
acceptable one, from the captain of an English frigate off
Salamis. In that number, Art. 3, containing the review of
a French translation of Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> there are introduced some
remarks on the modern Greeks and their literature, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
short account of Coray, a co-translator in the French
version. On those remarks I mean to ground a few observations;
and the spot where I now write will, I hope, be
sufficient excuse for introducing them in a work in some
degree connected with the subject. Coray, the most celebrated
of living Greeks, at least among the Franks, was born
at Scio (in the <i>Review</i>, Smyrna is stated, I have reason to
think, incorrectly), and besides the translation of Beccaria
and other works mentioned by the Reviewer, has published
a lexicon in Romaic and French, if I may trust the assurance
of some Danish travellers lately arrived from Paris; but the
latest we have seen here in French and Greek is that of
Gregory Zolikogloou.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
Coray has recently been involved
in an unpleasant controversy with M. Gail,<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> a Parisian
commentator and editor of some translations from the Greek
poets, in consequence of the Institute having awarded him
the prize for his version of Hippocrates'
"<span title="Peri\ y(da/t&ocirc;n">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#8017;&#948;&#8049;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>," etc., to
the disparagement, and consequently displeasure, of the said
Gail. To his exertions, literary and patriotic, great praise
is undoubtedly due; but a part of that praise ought not to
be withheld from the two brothers Zosimado (merchants
settled in Leghorn), who sent him to Paris and maintained
him, for the express purpose of elucidating the ancient, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
adding to the modern, researches of his countrymen. Coray,
however, is not considered by his countrymen equal to some
who lived in the two last centuries; more particularly
Dorotheus of Mitylene,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
whose Hellenic writings are so much
esteemed by the Greeks, that Meletius<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
terms him
"<span title="Meta\ to\n Thoukydi/d&ecirc;n kai\ Xenoph&ocirc;/nta a)/ristos E(ll&ecirc;/n&ocirc;n">&#924;&#949;&#964;&#8048;

<p>Panagiotes Kodrikas, the translator of Fontenelle, and
Kamarases,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> who translated Ocellus Lucanus on the
Universe into French, Christodoulus,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and more particularly
Psalida,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> whom I have conversed with in Joannina, are also
in high repute among their literati. The last-mentioned
has published in Romaic and Latin a work on
<i>True Happiness</i>, dedicated to Catherine II. But Polyzois,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
is stated by the Reviewer to be the only modern except
Coray who has distinguished himself by a knowledge of
Hellenic, if he be the Polyzois Lampanitziotes of Yanina,
who has published a number of editions in Romaic, was
neither more nor less than an itinerant vender of books;
with the contents of which he had no concern beyond his
name on the title page, placed there to secure his property
in the publication; and he was, moreover, a man utterly
destitute of scholastic acquirements. As the name, however,
is not uncommon, some other Polyzois may have edited the
Epistles of Arist&aelig;netus.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that the system of continental blockade
has closed the few channels through which the Greeks
received their publications, particularly Venice and Trieste.
Even the common grammars for children are become too
dear for the lower orders. Amongst their original works the
Geography of Meletius, Archbishop of Athens, and a multitude
of theological quartos and poetical pamphlets, are to be
met with; their grammars and lexicons of two, three, and
four languages are numerous and excellent. Their poetry is
in rhyme. The most singular piece I have lately seen is a
satire in dialogue between a Russian, English, and French
traveller, and the Waywode of Wallachia (or Blackbey, as
they term him), an archbishop, a merchant,<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> and Cogia
Bachi (or primate), in succession; to all of whom under the
Turks the writer attributes their present degeneracy. Their
songs are sometimes pretty and pathetic, but their tunes
generally unpleasing to the ear of a Frank; the best is the
famous
"<span title="Deu/te, pai~des t&ocirc;~n E(ll&ecirc;/n&ocirc;n">&#916;&#949;&#8059;&#964;&#949;,
&#960;&#945;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#7961;&#955;&#955;&#8053;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span>,"
by the unfortunate
Riga.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
But from a catalogue of more than sixty authors, now before
me, only fifteen can be found who have touched on any
theme except theology.</p>

<p>I am intrusted with a commission by a Greek of Athens
named Marmarotouri to make arrangements, if possible, for
printing in London a translation of Barthelemi's <i>Anacharsis</i>
in Romaic, as he has no other opportunity, unless he
dispatches the MS. to Vienna by the Black Sea and Danube.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>The Reviewer mentions a school established at Hecatonesi,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>
and suppressed at the instigation of Sebastiani:<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
he means Cidonies, or, in Turkish, Haivali; a town on the
continent, where that institution for a hundred students and
three professors still exists. It is true that this establishment
was disturbed by the Porte, under the ridiculous
pretext that the Greeks were constructing a fortress instead
of a college; but on investigation, and the payment of some
purses to the Divan, it has been permitted to continue. The
principal professor, named Ueniamin (i.e. Benjamin), is stated
to be a man of talent, but a freethinker. He was born in
Lesbos, studied in Italy, and is master of Hellenic, Latin,
and some Frank languages: besides a smattering of the sciences.</p>

<p>Though it is not my intention to enter farther on this
topic than may allude to the article in question, I cannot
but observe that the Reviewer's lamentation over the fall
of the Greeks appears singular, when he closes it with these
words: "<i>The change is to be attributed to their misfortunes
rather than to any 'physical degradation.'</i>" It may be true
that the Greeks are not physically degenerated, and that Constantinople
contained on the day when it changed masters
as many men of six feet and upwards as in the hour of
prosperity; but ancient history and modern politics instruct
us that something more than physical perfection is necessary
to preserve a state in vigour and independence; and the
Greeks, in particular, are a melancholy example of the near
connexion between moral degradation and national decay.</p>

<p>The Reviewer mentions a plan "<i>we believe</i>" by Potemkin<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
for the purification of the Romaic; and I have endeavoured
in vain to procure any tidings or traces of its existence.
There was an academy in St. Petersburg for the Greeks;
but it was suppressed by Paul, and has not been revived by
his successor.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a slip of the pen, and it can only be a slip of the
pen, in p. 58, No. 31, of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, where these
words occur: "We are told that when the capital of the
East yielded to <i>Solyman</i>"&mdash;It may be presumed that this
last word will, in a future edition, be altered to Mahomet II.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
The "ladies of Constantinople," it seems, at that period spoke
a dialect, "which would not have disgraced the lips of an
Athenian." I do not know how that might be, but am sorry
to say that the ladies in general, and the Athenians in
particular, are much altered; being far from choice either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>in their dialect or expressions, as the whole Attic race are
barbarous to a proverb:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Gibbon, vol. x. p. 161, is the following sentence:&mdash;"The
vulgar dialect of the city was gross and barbarous, though
the compositions of the church and palace sometimes affected
to copy the purity of the Attic models." Whatever may be
asserted on the subject, it is difficult to conceive that the
"ladies of Constantinople," in the reign of the last C&aelig;sar,
spoke a purer dialect than Anna Comnena<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> wrote, three
centuries before: and those royal pages are not esteemed
the best models of composition, although the princess
<span title="gl&ocirc;~ttan ei~)chen A)KRIB&Ocirc;E A)ttikisou/san">&#947;&#955;&#8182;&#964;&#964;&#945;&#957;

In the Fanal, and in Yanina,
the best Greek is spoken: in the latter there is a flourishing
school under the direction of Psalida.</p>

<p>There is now in Athens a pupil of Psalida's, who is making
a tour of observation through Greece: he is intelligent, and
better educated than a fellow-commoner of most colleges.
I mention this as a proof that the spirit of inquiry is not
dormant among the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Reviewer mentions Mr. Wright,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> the author of the
beautiful poem <i>Hor&aelig; Ionic&aelig;</i>, as qualified to give details
of these nominal Romans and degenerate Greeks; and also
of their language: but Mr. Wright, though a good poet and
an able man, has made a mistake where he states the
Albanian dialect of the Romaic to approximate nearest
to the Hellenic; for the Albanians speak a Romaic as
notoriously corrupt as the Scotch of Aberdeenshire, or the
Italian of Naples. Yanina, (where, next to the Fanal, the
Greek is purest,) although the capital of Ali Pacha's dominions,
is not in Albania, but Epirus; and beyond Delvinachi in
Albania Proper up to Argyrocastro and Tepaleen (beyond
which I did not advance) they speak worse Greek than even
the Athenians. I was attended for a year and a half by two
of these singular mountaineers, whose mother tongue is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Illyric, and I never heard them or their countrymen (whom
I have seen, not only at home, but to the amount of twenty
thousand in the army of Vely Pacha<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>) praised for their
Greek, but often laughed at for their provincial barbarisms.</p>

<p>I have in my possession about twenty-five letters, amongst
which some from the Bey of Corinth, written to me by
Notaras, the Cogia Bachi, and others by the dragoman of
the Caimacam<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> of the Morea (which last governs in Vely
Pacha's absence), are said to be favourable specimens of
their epistolary style. I also received some at Constantinople
from private persons, written in a most hyperbolical
style, but in the true antique character.</p>

<p>The Reviewer proceeds, after some remarks on the tongue
in its past and present state, to a paradox (page 59) on the
great mischief the knowledge of his own language has done
to Coray, who, it seems, is less likely to understand the
ancient Greek, because he is perfect master of the modern!
This observation follows a paragraph, recommending, in
explicit terms, the study of the Romaic, as "a powerful
auxiliary," not only to the traveller and foreign merchant,
but also to the classical scholar; in short, to every body
except the only person who can be thoroughly acquainted
with its uses; and by a parity of reasoning, our own language
is conjectured to be probably more attainable by "foreigners"
than by ourselves! Now, I am inclined to think, that a
Dutch Tyro in our tongue (albeit himself of Saxon blood)
would be sadly perplexed with "Sir Tristram,"<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> or any other
given "Auchinleck MS." with or without a grammar or
glossary; and to most apprehensions it seems evident that
none but a native can acquire a competent, far less complete,

induced me to advert to those pages, which the advantage of
my present situation enabled me to clear, or at least to make
the attempt.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to waive the personal feelings which
rise in despite of me in touching upon any part of the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>; not from a wish to conciliate the favour
of its writers, or to cancel the remembrance of a syllable
I have formerly published, but simply from a sense of the
impropriety of mixing up private resentments with a
disquisition of the present kind, and more particularly at this
distance of time and place.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Additional Note on the Turks</span>.</h3>

<p>The difficulties of travelling in Turkey have been much
exaggerated, or rather have considerably diminished, of late
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
years. The Mussulmans have been beaten into a kind of
sullen civility very comfortable to voyagers.</p>

<p>It is hazardous to say much on the subject of Turks and
Turkey; since it is possible to live amongst them twenty
years without acquiring information, at least from themselves.
As far as my own slight experience carried me, I have no
complaint to make; but am indebted for many civilities
(I might almost say for friendship), and much hospitality, to
Ali Pacha, his son Vely Pacha of the Morea, and several
others of high rank in the provinces. Suleyman Aga, late
Governor of Athens, and now of Thebes, was a <i>bon vivant</i>,
and as social a being as ever sat cross-legged at a tray or a
table. During the carnival, when our English party were masquerading,
both himself and his successor were more happy
to "receive masks" than any dowager in Grosvenor-square.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>


<p>On one occasion of his supping at the convent, his friend
and visitor, the Cadi<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> of Thebes, was carried from table
perfectly qualified for any club in Christendom; while the
worthy Waywode himself triumphed in his fall.</p>

<p>In all money transactions with the Moslems, I ever found
the strictest honour, the highest disinterestedness. In transacting
business with them, there are none of those dirty
peculations, under the name of interest, difference of exchange,
commission, etc., etc., uniformly found in applying to a Greek
consul to cash bills, even on the first houses in Pera.</p>

<p>With regard to presents, an established custom in the
East, you will rarely find yourself a loser; as one worth
acceptance is generally returned by another of similar value&mdash;a
horse, or a shawl.</p>

<p>In the capital and at court the citizens and courtiers are
formed in the same school with those of Christianity; but
there does not exist a more honourable, friendly, and high-spirited
character than the true Turkish provincial Aga, or
Moslem country gentleman. It is not meant here to designate
the governors of towns, but those Agas who, by a kind
of feudal tenure, possess lands and houses, of more or less
extent, in Greece and Asia Minor.</p>

<p>The lower orders are in as tolerable discipline as the
rabble in countries with greater pretensions to civilisation.
A Moslem, in walking the streets of our country-towns, would
be more incommoded in England than a Frank in a similar
situation in Turkey. Regimentals are the best travelling dress.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>The best accounts of the religion and different sects of
Islamism may be found in D'Ohsson's<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> French; of their
manners, etc., perhaps in Thornton's English. The Ottomans,
with all their defects, are not a people to be despised.
Equal at least to the Spaniards, they are superior to the
Portuguese. If it be difficult to pronounce what they are,
we can at least say what they are <i>not</i>:
they are <i>not</i> treacherous,
they are <i>not</i> cowardly, they do <i>not</i> burn heretics, they
are <i>not</i> assassins, nor has an enemy advanced to <i>their</i>
capital. They are faithful to their sultan till he becomes
unfit to govern, and devout to their God without an inquisition.
Were they driven from St. Sophia to-morrow, and
the French or Russians enthroned in their stead, it would
become a question whether Europe would gain by the exchange.
England would certainly be the loser.</p>

<p>With regard to that ignorance of which they are so
generally, and sometimes justly accused, it may be doubted,
always excepting France and England, in what useful points
of knowledge they are excelled by other nations. Is it in the
common arts of life? In their manufactures? Is a Turkish
sabre inferior to a Toledo? or is a Turk worse clothed or
lodged, or fed and taught, than a Spaniard? Are their
Pachas worse educated than a Grandee? or an Effendi<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>
than a Knight of St. Jago? I think not.</p>


<p>I remember Mahmout, the grandson of Ali Pacha, asking
whether my fellow-traveller and myself were in the upper or
lower House of Parliament. Now, this question from a boy
of ten years old proved that his education had not been
neglected. It may be doubted if an English boy at that age
knows the difference of the Divan from a College of Dervises;
but I am very sure a Spaniard does not. How little Mahmout,
surrounded as he had been entirely by his Turkish
tutors, had learned that there was such a thing as a Parliament,
it were useless to conjecture, unless we suppose that his
instructors did not confine his studies to the Koran.</p>

<p>In all the mosques there are schools established, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
are very regularly attended; and the poor are taught without
the church of Turkey being put into peril. I believe the
system is not yet printed (though there is such a thing as a
Turkish press, and books printed on the late military institution
of the Nizam Gedidd);<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> nor have I heard whether the
Mufti and the Mollas have subscribed, or the Caimacan and
the Tefterdar taken the alarm, for fear the ingenuous youth
of the turban should be taught not to "pray to God their way."
The Greeks also&mdash;a kind of Eastern Irish papists&mdash;have
a college of their own at Maynooth,&mdash;no, at Haivali;
where the heterodox receive much the same kind of countenance
from the Ottoman as the Catholic college from the
English legislature. Who shall then affirm that the Turks
are ignorant bigots, when they thus evince the exact proportion
of Christian charity which is tolerated in the most
prosperous and orthodox of all possible kingdoms? But
though they allow all this, they will not suffer the Greeks to
participate in their privileges: no, let them fight their battles,
and pay their haratch (taxes), be drubbed in this world, and
damned in the next. And shall we then emancipate our
Irish Helots? Mahomet forbid! We should then be bad
Mussulmans, and worse Christians: at present we unite the
best of both&mdash;jesuitical faith, and something not much
inferior to Turkish toleration.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3><span class="smcap">Appendix</span>.</h3>

<p>Amongst an enslaved people, obliged to have recourse to
foreign presses even for their books of religion, it is less to be
wondered at that we find so few publications on general
subjects than that we find any at all. The whole number of
the Greeks, scattered up and down the Turkish empire and
elsewhere, may amount, at most, to three millions; and yet,
for so scanty a number, it is impossible to discover any
nation with so great a proportion of books and their authors
as the Greeks of the present century. "Aye," but say the
generous advocates of oppression, who, while they assert
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the ignorance of the Greeks, wish to prevent them from dispelling
it, "ay, but these are mostly, if not all, ecclesiastical
tracts, and consequently good for nothing." Well! and pray
what else can they write about? It is pleasant enough to
hear a Frank, particularly an Englishman, who may abuse
the government of his own country; or a Frenchman, who
may abuse every government except his own, and who may
range at will over every philosophical, religious, scientific,
sceptical, or moral subject, sneering at the Greek legends.
A Greek must not write on politics, and cannot touch on
science for want of instruction; if he doubts he is excommunicated
and damned; therefore his countrymen are not
poisoned with modern philosophy; and as to morals, thanks
to the Turks! there are no such things. What then is left
him, if he has a turn for scribbling? Religion and holy
biography; and it is natural enough that those who have so
little in this life should look to the next. It is no great
wonder then, that in a catalogue now before me of fifty-five
Greek writers, many of whom were lately living, not above
fifteen should have touched on anything but religion. The
catalogue alluded to is contained in the twenty-sixth chapter
of the fourth volume of Meletius' <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>.</p>

<p>[The above forms a preface to an Appendix, headed
"Remarks on the Romaic or Modern Greek Language, with
Specimens and Translations," which was printed at the end
of the volume, after the "Poems," in the first and successive
editions of <i>Childe Harold</i>. It contains
(1) a "List of Romaic Authors;"

"a Satire in dialogue" (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Page_196">Note III.</a> <i>supra</i>),

(7) "The Inscriptions at Orchomenos from Meletius"
(see <i>Travels in Albania, etc.</i>, i. 224);
(8) the "Prospectus of a Translation of Anacharsis
into Romaic, by my Romaic master, Marmarotouri, who
wished to publish it in England;"
(9) "The Lord's Prayer in Romaic" and in Greek.</p>

which it affords of Byron's industry and zeal for acquiring
knowledge, than for the value or interest of the subject-matter,
has been omitted from the present issue. The

that they were deterred from attacking us by the appearance

[According to Bryant's <i>Dict. of Painters</i>, and other biographical
dictionaries, Karl Wilhelm Gropius (whom Lamartine,
in his <i>Voyage en Orient</i>, identifies with the Gropius
"injustement accus&eacute; par lord Byron dans ses notes mordantes
sur Ath&egrave;nes") was born at Brunswick, in 1793,
travelled in Italy and Greece, making numerous landscape
and architectural sketches, and finally settled at Berlin in
1827, where he opened a diorama, modelled on that of
Daguerre, "in connection with a permanent exhibition of
painting.... He was considered the first wit in Berlin,
where he died in 1870." In 1812, when Byron wrote his
note to the third edition of <i>Childe Harold</i>, Gropius must
have been barely of age, and the statement "that he has for
years assumed the name of his (a noble Lord's) agent" is
somewhat perplexing.]</p></div>

Dr. Pouqueville, who have been guilty between them of sadly
clipping the Sultan's Turkish.<a href="#en_240_A">[A]</a>
</p><p>
Dr. Pouqueville tells a long story of a Moslem who
swallowed corrosive sublimate in such quantities that he
acquired the name of "<i>Suleyman Yeyen</i>" i.e. quoth the
Doctor, "<i>Suleyman the eater of corrosive sublimate</i>."
"Aha," thinks Mr. Thornton (angry with the Doctor for the
fiftieth time), "have I caught you?"<a href="#en_240_B">[B]</a>&mdash;Then, in a note,
twice the thickness of the Doctor's anecdote, he questions
the Doctor's proficiency in the Turkish tongue, and his
veracity in his own.&mdash;"For," observes Mr. Thornton
(after inflicting on us the tough participle of a Turkish verb),
"it means nothing more than '<i>Suleyman the eater</i>,' and quite
cashiers the supplementary '<i>sublimate</i>.'" Now both are
right, and both are wrong. If Mr. Thornton, when he next
resides "fourteen years in the factory," will consult his
Turkish dictionary, or ask any of his Stamboline acquaintance,
he will discover that "<i>Suleyma'n yeyen</i>," put together
discreetly, mean the "<i>Swallower of sublimate</i>" without any
"Suleyman" in the case: "<i>Suleyma</i>" signifying
"<i>corrosive sublimate</i>" and not being a proper name
on this occasion, although it be an orthodox name enough with
the addition of <i>n</i>. After Mr. Thornton's frequent
hints of profound Orientalism, he might have found this out
before he sang such p&aelig;ans over Dr. Pouqueville.
</p><p>
After this, I think "Travellers <i>versus</i> Factors" shall be
our motto, though the above Mr. Thornton has condemned
"hoc genus omne," for mistake and misrepresentation.
"Ne Sutor ultra crepidam," "No merchant beyond his
bales." N.B. For the benefit of Mr. Thornton, "Sutor" is
not a proper name.

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_THIRD" id="INTRODUCTION_THIRD"></a>INTRODUCTION TO THE THIRD CANTO.
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> was begun early in May,
and finished at Ouchy, near Lausanne, on the 27th of June,
1816. Byron made a fair copy of the first draft of his poem,
which had been scrawled on loose sheets, and engaged the
services of "Claire" (Jane Clairmont) to make a second
transcription. Her task was completed on the 4th of July.
The fair copy and Claire's transcription remained in Byron's
keeping until the end of August or the beginning of September,
when he consigned the transcription to "his friend
Mr. Shelley," and the fair copy to Scrope Davies, with
instructions to deliver them to Murray (see Letters to Murray,
October 5, 9, 15, 1816). Shelley landed at Portsmouth,
September 8, and on the 11th of September he discharged
his commission.</p>

<p>"I was thrilled with delight yesterday," writes Murray
(September 12), "by the announcement of Mr. Shelley with
the MS. of <i>Childe Harold</i>. I had no sooner got the quiet
possession of it than, trembling with auspicious hope, ... I
carried it ... to Mr. Gifford.... He says that what you
have heretofore published is nothing to this effort....
Never, since my intimacy with Mr. Gifford, did I see him so
heartily pleased, or give one fiftieth part of the praise, with
one thousandth part of the warmth."</p>

<p>The correction of the press was undertaken by Gifford,
not without some remonstrance on the part of Shelley, who
maintained that "the revision of the proofs, and the retention
or alteration of certain particular passages had been
entrusted to his discretion" (Letter to Murray, October 30,
1816).</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>When, if ever, Mr. Davies, of "inaccurate memory"
(Letter to Murray, December 4, 1816), discharged his trust
is a matter of uncertainty. The "original MS." (Byron's "fair
copy") is not forthcoming, and it is improbable that Murray,
who had stipulated (September 20) "for all the original
MSS., copies, and scraps," ever received it. The "scraps"
were sent (October 5) in the first instance to Geneva, and,
after many wanderings, ultimately fell into the possession of
Mrs. Leigh, from whom they were purchased by the late Mr. Murray.</p>

<p>The July number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (No. XXX.) was
still in the press, and, possibly, for this reason it was not till
October 29 that Murray inserted the following advertisement
in the <i>Morning Chronicle:</i> "Lord Byron's New Poems.
On the 23<span class="sup">d</span> of November will be published The Prisoners (<i>sic</i>)
of Chillon, a Tale and other Poems. A Third Canto of Childe
Harold...." But a rival was in the field. The next day
(October 30), in the same print, another advertisement appeared:
"<i>The R. H. Lord Byron's Pilgrimage to the Holy Land....</i>
Printed for J. Johnston, Cheapside.... Of
whom may be had, by the same author, a new ed. (the third)
of <i>Farewell to England: with three other poems....</i>"
It was, no doubt, the success of his first venture which had
stimulated the "Cheapside impostor," as Byron called him,
to forgery on a larger scale.</p>

<p>The controversy did not end there. A second advertisement
(<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, November 15) of "Lord Byron's
Pilgrimage," etc., stating that "the copyright of the work
was consigned" to the Publisher "exclusively by the Noble
Author himself, and for which he gives 500 guineas," precedes
Murray's second announcement of <i>The Prisoners of Chillon</i>,
and the Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, in which he informs
"the public that the poems lately advertised are not written
by Lord Byron. The only bookseller at present authorised
to print Lord Byron's poems is Mr. Murray...." Further
precautions were deemed necessary. An injunction in
Chancery was applied for by Byron's agents and representatives
(see, for a report of the case in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
November 28, 1816, <i>Letters</i>, vol. iv., Letter to Murray,
December 9, 1816, note), and granted by the Chancellor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Lord Eldon. Strangely enough, Sir Samuel Romilly, whom
Byron did not love, was counsel for the plaintiff.</p>

<p>In spite of the injunction, a volume entitled "<i>Lord Byron's
Pilgrimage to the Holy Land</i>, a Poem in Two Cantos. To
which is attached a fragment, <i>The Tempest</i>," was issued in 1817.
It is a dull and, apparently, serious production, suggested
by, but hardly an imitation of, <i>Childe Harold</i>. The notes
are descriptive of the scenery, customs, and antiquities of
Palestine. <i>The Tempest</i>, on the other hand, is a parody, and
by no means a bad parody, of Byron at his worst; e.g.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There was a sternness in his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which chilled the soul&mdash;one knew not why&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when returning vigour came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindled the dark glare to flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fierce it flashed, one well might swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand souls were centred there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is possible that this <i>Pilgrimage</i> was the genuine composition
of some poetaster who failed to get his poems published
under his own name, or it may have been the deliberate
forgery of John Agg, or Hewson Clarke, or C. F. Lawler,
the <i>pseudo</i> Peter Pindar&mdash;"Druids" who were in Johnston's
pay, and were prepared to compose pilgrimages to any land,
holy or unholy, which would bring grist to their employer's
mill. (See the <i>Advertisements</i> at the end of <i>Lord Byron's
Pilgrimage, etc.</i>)</p>

<p>The Third Canto was published, not as announced, on
the 23rd, but on the 18th of November. Murray's "auspicious
hope" of success was amply fulfilled. He "wrote to Lord
Byron on the 13th of December, 1816, informing him that
at a dinner at the Albion Tavern, he had sold to the assembled
booksellers 7000 of his Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>...."
The reviews were for the most part laudatory. Sir Walter
Scott's finely-tempered eulogium (<i>Quart. Rev</i>., No. xxxi.,
October, 1816 [published February 11, 1817]), and Jeffrey's
balanced and cautious appreciation (<i>Edin. Rev</i>., No. liv.,
December, 1816 [published February 14, 1817]) have been
reprinted in their collected works. Both writers conclude
with an aspiration&mdash;Jeffrey, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"This puissant spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i11">Yet shall reascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-raised, and repossess its native seat!"<br /></span>
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Note on MSS. of the Third Canto.</span></h3>

<p>[The following memorandum, in Byron's handwriting, is
prefixed to the Transcription:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This copy is to be printed from&mdash;subject to comparison
with the original MS. (from which this is a transcription)
in such parts as it may chance to be difficult to decypher in
the following. The notes in this copy are more complete
and extended than in the former&mdash;and there is also
<i>one stanza more</i> inserted and added to this, viz. the 33d.&nbsp;B.</p>

<p style="text-indent:6em;margin-top:0;">Diodati, near y<span class="sup">e</span> Lake of Geneva."</p>
</div>

<p>The "original MS." to which the memorandum refers is
not forthcoming (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_212">p. 212</a>), but the "scraps" (MS.)
are now in Mr. Murray's possession. Stanzas i.-iii., and the
lines beginning, "The castled Crag of Drachenfels," are missing.</p>

<p>Claire's Transcription (C.) occupies the first 119 pages of
a substantial quarto volume. Stanzas xxxiii. and xcix.-cv.
and several of the notes are in Byron's handwriting. The
same volume contains <i>Sonnet on Chillon</i>, in Byron's handwriting;
a transcription of the <i>Prisoners</i> (<i>sic</i>) <i>of Chillon</i>
(so, too, the advertisement in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, October 29,
1816); <i>Sonnet</i>, "Rousseau," etc., in Byron's handwriting,
and transcriptions of <i>Stanzas to</i>&mdash;&mdash;, "Though the day of
my destiny's over;" <i>Darkness</i>; <i>Churchill's Grave</i>;
<i>The Dream</i>; <i>The Incantation</i>
(<i>Manfred</i>, act ii. sc. 1); and <i>Prometheus</i>.]</p>

Huntingdon peerage story, you will see how common a name Ada was in the
early Plantagenet days. I found it in my own pedigree in the reigns of
John and Henry.... It is short, ancient, vocalic, and had been in my
family; for which reasons I gave it to my daughter."&mdash;Letter to Murray,
Ravenna, October 8, 1820.
</p><p>
The Honourable Augusta Ada Byron was born December 10, 1815; was married
July 8, 1835, to William King Noel (1805-1893), eighth Baron King,
created Earl of Lovelace, 1838; and died November 27, 1852. There were
three children of the marriage&mdash;Viscount Ockham (d. 1862), the present
Earl of Lovelace, and the Lady Anna Isabella Noel, who was married to
Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, Esq., in 1869.
</p><p>
"The Countess of Lovelace," wrote a contributor to the <i>Examiner</i>,
December 4, 1852, "was thoroughly original, and the poet's temperament
was all that was hers in common with her father. Her genius, for genius
she possessed, was not poetic, but metaphysical and mathematical, her
mind having been in the constant practice of investigation, and with
rigour and exactness." Of her devotion to science, and her original
powers as a mathematician, her translation and explanatory notes of F.
L. Menabrea's <i>Notices sur le machine Analytique de Mr. Babbage</i>, 1842,
a defence of the famous "calculating machine," remain as evidence.
</p><p>
"Those who view mathematical science not merely as a vast body of
abstract and immutable truths, ... but as possessing a yet deeper
interest for the human race, when it is remembered that this science
constitutes the language through which alone we can adequately express
the great facts of the natural world ... those who thus think on
mathematical truth as the instrument through which the weak mind of man
can most effectually read his Creator's works, will regard with especial
interest all that can tend to facilitate the translation of its
principles into explicit practical forms." So, for the moment turning
away from algebraic formul&aelig; and abstruse calculations, wrote Ada, Lady
Lovelace, in her twenty-eighth year. See "Translator's Notes," signed A.
A. L., to <i>A Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles
Babbage, Esq.</i>, London, 1843.
</p><p>
It would seem, however, that she "wore her learning lightly as a
flower." "Her manners [<i>Examiner</i>], her tastes, her accomplishments, in
many of which, music especially, she was proficient, were feminine in
the nicest sense of the word." Unlike her father in features, or in the
bent of her mind, she inherited his mental vigour and intensity of
purpose. Like him, she died in her thirty-seventh year, and at her own
request her coffin was placed by his in the vault at Hucknall Torkard.
(See, too, <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, December 4, 1852, and <i>Gent. Mag.</i>, January,
1853.)]</p></div>

"Out of this somewhat forced simile," says the editor (John Wright) of
Lord Byron's <i>Poetical Works</i>, issued in 1832, "by a judicious
transposition of the comparison, and by the substitution of the more
definite <i>waves</i> for <i>seas</i>, Lord Byron's clear and noble thought has
been produced." But the literary artifice, if such there be, is
subordinate to the emotion of the writer. It is in movement, progress,
flight, that the sufferer experiences a relief from the poignancy of his
anguish.]</p></div>

suggested by the action of a flood, which ploughs a channel for itself
through fruitful soil, and, when the waters are spent, leaves behind it
"a sterile track," which does, indeed, permit the traveller to survey
the desolation, but serves no other purpose of use or beauty.]</p></div>

"Life is but thought," and by the power of the imagination he thinks to
"gain a being more intense," to add a cubit to his spiritual stature.

At this stage of his poetic growth, in part converted by Shelley, in

was, too, a compulsion from within. Life had gone wrong with him, and,
driven from memory and reflection, he looks for redemption in the new

On the tale or spell of his own tragedy is set the seal of silence; but
of Harold, the idealized Byron, he once more takes up the parable. In
stanzas viii.-xv. he puts the reader in possession of some natural
changes, and unfolds the development of thought and feeling which had
befallen the Pilgrim since last they had journeyed together. The
youthful Harold had sounded the depth of joy and woe. Man delighted him
not&mdash;no, nor woman neither. For a time, however, he had cured himself of
this trick of sadness. He had drunk new life from the fountain of
natural beauty and antique lore, and had returned to take his part in
the world, inly armed against dangers and temptations. And in the world
he had found beauty, and fame had found him. What wonder that he had
done as others use, and then discovered that he could not fare as others
fared? Henceforth there remained no comfort but in nature, no refuge but
in exile!]</p></div>

Waterloo. When Byron was in Brussels, a friend of his boyhood, Pryse
Lockhart Gordon, called upon him and offered his services. He escorted
him to the field of Waterloo, and received him at his house in the
evening. Mrs. Gordon produced her album, and begged for an autograph.
The next morning Byron copied into the album the two stanzas which he
had written the day before. Lines 5-8 of the second stanza (xviii.) ran
thus&mdash;

The autograph suggested an illustration to an artist, R. R. Reinagle
(1775-1863), "a pencil-sketch of a spirited chained eagle, grasping the
earth with his talons." Gordon showed the vignette to Byron, who wrote
in reply, "Reinagle is a better poet and a better ornithologist than I

their beaks, and I have altered the line thus&mdash;

now famous ball," writes Lady de Ros (<i>A Sketch, etc.</i>, pp. 122, 123),
"took place in a large room on the ground-floor on the left of the
entrance, connected with the rest of the house by an ante-room. It had
been used by the coachbuilder, from whom the house was hired, to put
carriages in, but it was papered before we came there; and I recollect
the paper&mdash;a trellis pattern with roses.... When the duke arrived,
rather late, at the ball, I was dancing, but at once went up to him to
ask about the rumours. 'Yes, they are true; we are off to-morrow.' This
terrible news was circulated directly, and while some of the officers
hurried away, others remained at the ball, and actually had not time to
change their clothes, but fought in evening costume."]</p></div>

But the contrast between the continuous action of nature and the doom of
the unreturning dead, which does not greatly concern Southey, fills
Byron with a fierce desire to sum the price of victory. He flings in the
face of the vain-glorious mourners the bitter reality of their abiding
loss. It was this prophetic note, "the voice of one crying in the

But, as M. Darmesteter points out, the true source of inspiration was a
passage in Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>&mdash;"the book," as Byron
maintained, "in my opinion most useful to a man who wishes to acquire
the reputation of being well-read with the least trouble" (<i>Life</i>, p.
48). Burton is discoursing on injury and long-suffering. "'Tis a Hydra's
head contention; the more they strive, the more they may; and as
Praxiteles did by his glass [see Cardan, <i>De Consolatione</i>, lib. iii.],
when he saw a scurvy face in it, break it in pieces; but for the one he
saw, he saw many more as bad in a moment; for one injury done, they
provoke another <i>cum fanore</i>, and twenty enemies for one."&mdash;<i>Anatomy of

[Byron seems to have been unable to make up his mind
about Napoleon. "It is impossible not to be dazzled and overwhelmed by
his character and career," he wrote to Moore (March 17, 1815), when his
H&eacute;ros de Roman, as he called him, had broken open his "captive's cage"
and was making victorious progress to the capital. In the <i>Ode to
Napoleon Buonaparte</i>, which was written in April, 1814, after the first
abdication at Fontainebleau, the dominant note is astonishment mingled
with contempt. It is the lamentation over a fallen idol. In these
stanzas (xxxvi.-xlv.) he bears witness to the man's essential greatness,
and, with manifest reference to his own personality and career,
attributes his final downfall to the peculiar constitution of his genius
and temper. A year later (1817), in the Fourth Canto (stanzas
lxxxix.-xcii.), he passes a severe sentence. Napoleon's greatness is
swallowed up in weakness. He is a "kind of bastard C&aelig;sar,"
self-vanquished, the creature and victim of vanity. Finally, in The Age
of Bronze, sections iii.-vi., there is a reversion to the same theme,
the tragic irony of the rise and fall of the "king of kings, and yet of
slaves the slave."
</p><p>
As a schoolboy at Harrow, Byron fought for the preservation of
Napoleon's bust, and he was ever ready, in defiance of national feeling
and national prejudice, to celebrate him as "the glorious chief;" but
when it came to the point, he did not "want him here," victorious over
England, and he could not fail to see, with insight quickened by
self-knowledge, that greatness and genius possess no charm against
littleness and commonness, and that the "glory of the terrestrial" meets
with its own reward. The moral is obvious, and as old as history; but
herein lay the secret of Byron's potency, that he could remint and issue
in fresh splendour the familiar coinage of the world's wit. Moreover, he
lived in a great age, when great truths are born again, and appear in a
new light.]</p></div>

that she too was cognizant of the calumnious accusations; for under no
other supposition is it possible to understand their allusions." But the
mere fact that Mrs. Leigh remained on terms of intimacy and affection
with her brother, when he was under the ban of society, would expose her
to slander and injurious comment, "peril dreaded most in female eyes;"

gossip-monger, Byron took refuge, on June 10, at the Villa Diodati; but
still the pursuers strove to win some wretched consolation by waylaying
him in his evening drives, or directing the telescope upon his balcony,
which overlooked the lake, or upon the hillside, with its vineyards,
where he lurked obscure" (Dowden's <i>Life of Shelley</i>, 1896, p. 309). It
is possible, too, that now and again even Shelley's companionship was
felt to be a strain upon nerves and temper. The escape from memory and
remorse, which could not be always attained in the society of a chosen
few, might, he hoped, be found in solitude, face to face with nature.
But it was not to be. Even nature was powerless to "minister to a mind
diseased." At the conclusion of his second tour (September 29, 1816), he
is constrained to admit that "neither the music of the shepherd, the
crashing of the avalanche, nor the torrent, the mountain, the glacier,
the forest, nor the cloud, have for one moment lightened the weight upon
my heart, nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the
majesty, and the power, and the glory, around, above, and beneath me"
(<i>Life</i>, p. 315). Perhaps Wordsworth had this confession in his mind
when, in 1834, he composed the lines, "Not in the Lucid Intervals of
Life," of which the following were, he notes, "written with Lord Byron's
character as a past before me, and that of others, his contemporaries,

Wordsworth seems to have resented Byron's tardy conversion to "natural
piety," regarding it, no doubt, as a fruitless and graceless endeavour
without the cross to wear the crown. But if Nature reserves her balms
for "the innocent," her quality of inspiration is not "strained." Byron,
too, was nature's priest&mdash;

that man is the creature and thrall of fate. In society, in the world,
he is exposed to the incidence of passion, which he can neither resist
nor yield to without torture. He is overcome by the world, and, as a
last resource, he turns to nature and solitude. He lifts up his eyes to
the hills, unexpectant of Divine aid, but in the hope that, by claiming
kinship with Nature, and becoming "a portion of that around" him, he may
forego humanity, with its burden of penitence, and elude the curse.

Notwithstanding the splendour of Shelley's verse, it is difficult to
suppress a smile. For better or for worse, the sense of the ludicrous
has asserted itself, and "brother" cannot take "brother" quite so
seriously as in "the brave days of old." But to each age its own humour.
Not only did Shelley and Byron worship at the shrine of Rousseau, but
they took delight in reverently tracing the footsteps of St. Preux and
Julie.]</p></div>

He would not question Nature in search of new and untainted pleasure,
but rests in her as inclusive of humanity. The secret of Wordsworth is
acquiescence; "the still, sad music of humanity" is the key-note of his
ethic. Byron, on the other hand, is in revolt. He has the ardour of a
pervert, the rancorous scorn of a deserter. The "hum of human cities" is
a "torture." He is "a link reluctant in a fleshly chain." To him Nature
and Humanity are antagonists, and he cleaves to the one, yea, he would
take her by violence, to mark his alienation and severance from the
other.]</p></div>

Byron infuses into Rousseau's accurate and charming compositions of
scenic effects, if not the "glory," yet "the freshness of a dream." He
belonged to the new age, with its new message from nature to man, and,
in spite of theories and prejudices, listened and was convinced. He
extols Rousseau's recognition of nature, lifting it to the height of his
own argument; but, consciously or unconsciously, he desires to find, and
finds, in nature a spring of imagination undreamt of by the Apostle of
Sentiment. There is a whole world of difference between Rousseau's
persuasive and delicate patronage of Nature, and Byron's passionate,
though somewhat belated, surrender to her inevitable claim. With
Rousseau, Nature is a means to an end, a conduct of refined and
heightened fancy; whereas, to Byron, "her reward was with her," a
draught of healing and refreshment.]</p></div>

had in mind certain strictures of the lake school&mdash;"a school, as it is
called, I presume, from their education being still incomplete."
Coleridge, in <i>The Friend</i> (1850, i. 168), contrasting Voltaire with
Erasmus, affirms that "the knowledge of the one was solid through its
whole extent, and that of the other extensive at a chief rate in its
superficiality," and characterizes "the wit of the Frenchman" as being
"without imagery, without character, and without that pathos which gives
the magic charm to genuine humour;" and Wordsworth, in the second book
of <i>The Excursion</i> (<i>Works of Wordsworth</i>, 1889, p. 434), "unalarmed" by
any consideration of wit or humour, writes down Voltaire's <i>Optimist</i>
(<i>Candide, ou L'Optimisme</i>), which was accidentally discovered by the
"Wanderer" in the "Solitary's" pent-house, "swoln with scorching damp,"
as "the dull product of a scoffer's pen." Byron reverts to these
contumelies in a note to the Fifth Canto of <i>Don Juan</i> (see <i>Life</i>,
Appendix, p. 809), and lashes "the school" <i>secundum artem.</i>]</p></div>

accepted the dedication of <i>Mahomet</i> (1745), and bestowed an apostolical

his protection of the oppressed, and, above all, the questioning spirit

compliment" of showing her the transcription of the Third Canto, a day
or two after it came into his possession. Most probably she did not know
or recognize Claire's handwriting, but she could not fail to remember
that but one short year ago she had herself been engaged in transcribing
<i>The Siege of Corinth</i> and <i>Parisina</i> for the press. Between the making
of those two "fair copies," a tragedy had intervened.]</p></div>

<p>The wood of Soignies is supposed to be a remnant of the
forest of Ardennes, famous in Bojardo's <i>Orlando</i>, and immortal
in Shakspeare's <i>As You Like It</i>. It is also celebrated
in Tacitus, as being the spot of successful defence by the
Germans against the Roman encroachments. I have ventured
to adopt the name connected with nobler associations
than those of mere slaughter.</p>

<p>[It is a far cry from Soignies in South Brabant to Ardennes
in Luxembourg. Possibly Byron is confounding the "saltus
quibus nomen Arduenna" (Tacitus, <i>Ann.</i>, 3. 42), the scene
of the revolt of the Treviri, with the "saltus Teutoburgiensis"
(the Teutoburgen or Lippische Wald, which divides Lippe
Detmold from Westphalia), where Arminius defeated the
Romans (Tacitus, <i>Ann</i>., 1. 60). (For Boiardo's "Ardenna,"
see <i>Orlando Innamorato</i>, lib. i. canto 2, st. 30.)
Shakespeare's Arden, the "immortal" forest, in <i>As You Like It</i>,
"favours" his own Arden in Warwickshire, but derived its
name from the "forest of Arden" in Lodge's <i>Rosalynd</i>.]</p>

<p>My guide from Mount St. Jean over the field seemed
intelligent and accurate. The place where Major Howard
fell was not far from two tall and solitary trees (there was a
third cut down, or shivered in the battle), which stand a few
yards from each other at a pathway's side. Beneath these
he died and was buried. The body has since been removed
to England. A small hollow for the present marks where it
lay, but will probably soon be effaced; the plough has been
upon it, and the grain is. After pointing out the different
spots where Picton and other gallant men had perished; the
guide said, "Here Major Howard lay: I was near him when
wounded." I told him my relationship, and he seemed then
still more anxious to point out the particular spot and circumstances.
The place is one of the most marked in the field,
from the peculiarity of the two trees above mentioned. I
went on horseback twice over the field, comparing it with
my recollection of similar scenes. As a plain, Waterloo
seems marked out for the scene of some great action, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
this may be mere imagination: I have viewed with attention
those of Platea, Troy, Mantinea, Leuctra, Ch&aelig;ronea, and
Marathon; and the field around Mount St. Jean and Hougoumont
appears to want little but a better cause, and that
undefinable but impressive halo which the lapse of ages
throws around a celebrated spot, to vie in interest with any
or all of these, except, perhaps, the last mentioned.</p>

<p>The castle of Drachenfels stands on the highest summit
of "the Seven Mountains," over the Rhine banks; it is in
ruins, and connected with some singular traditions. It is
the first in view on the road from Bonn, but on the opposite
side of the river: on this bank, nearly facing it, are the
remains of another, called the Jew's Castle, and a large
cross, commemorative of the murder of a chief by his brother.
The number of castles and cities along the course of the
Rhine on both sides is very great, and their situations
remarkably beautiful.</p>

<p>[The castle of Drachenfels (Dragon's Rock) stands on the
summit of one, but not the highest, of the Siebengebirge, an
isolated group of volcanic hills on the right bank of the
Rhine between Remagen and Bonn. The legend runs that
in one of the caverns of the rock dwelt the dragon which
was slain by Siegfried, the hero of the Nibelungen Lied.

<p>The monument of the young and lamented General Marceau
(killed by a rifle-ball at Alterkirchen, on the last day of
the fourth year of the French Republic) still remains as
described. The inscriptions on his monument are rather
too long, and not required: his name was enough; France
adored, and her enemies admired; both wept over him.
His funeral was attended by the generals and detachments
from both armies. In the same grave General Hoche is
interred, a gallant man also in every sense of the word; but
though he distinguished himself greatly in battle, he had not
the good fortune to die there: his death was attended by
suspicions of poison.</p>

<p>A separate monument (not over his body, which is buried
by Marceau's) is raised for him near Andernach, opposite
to which one of his most memorable exploits was performed,
in throwing a bridge to an island on the Rhine [April 18,
1797]. The shape and style are different from that of
Marceau's, and the inscription more simple and pleasing.</p>

<p>Ehrenbreitstein, i.e. "the broad stone of honour," one of
the strongest fortresses in Europe, was dismantled and blown
up by the French at the truce of Leoben. It had been, and
could only be, reduced by famine or treachery. It yielded
to the former, aided by surprise. After having seen the
fortifications of Gibraltar and Malta, it did not much strike
by comparison; but the situation is commanding. General
Marceau besieged it in vain for some time, and I slept in a
room where I was shown a window at which he is said to
have been standing observing the progress of the siege by
moonlight, when a ball struck immediately below it.</p>

<p>[Ehrenbreitstein, which had resisted the French under
Marshal Boufflers in 1680, and held out against Marceau
(1795-96), finally capitulated to the French after a prolonged
siege in 1799. The fortifications were dismantled when the
French evacuated the fortress after the Treaty of Lun&eacute;ville
in 1801. The Treaty of Leoben was signed April 18, 1797.]</p>

<p>The chapel is destroyed, and the pyramid of bones
diminished to a small number by the Burgundian Legion in
the service of France; who anxiously effaced this record of
their ancestors' less successful invasions. A few still remain,
notwithstanding the pains taken by the Burgundians for
ages (all who passed that way removing a bone to their
own country), and the less justifiable larcenies of the Swiss
postilions, who carried them off to sell for knife-handles;
a purpose for which the whiteness imbibed by the bleaching
of years had rendered them in great request. Of these relics
I ventured to bring away as much as may have made a
quarter of a hero, for which the sole excuse is, that if I had
not, the next passer-by might have perverted them to worse
uses than the careful preservation which I intend for them.</p>

<p>[Charles the Bold was defeated by the Swiss at the Battle
of Morat, June 22, 1476. It has been computed that more
than twenty thousand Burgundians fell in the battle. At
first, to avoid the outbreak of a pestilence, the bodies were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
thrown into pits. "Nine years later ... the mouldering
remains were unearthed, and deposited in a building ... on
the shore of the lake, near the village of Meyriez.... During
three succeeding centuries this depository was several
times rebuilt.... But the ill-starred relics were not destined
even yet to remain undisturbed. At the close of the last
century, when the armies of the French Republic were
occupying Switzerland, a regiment consisting mainly of
Burgundians, under the notion of effacing an insult to their
ancestors, tore down the 'bone-house' at Morat, covered
the contents with earth, and planted on the mound 'a tree
of liberty.' But the tree had no roots; the rains washed
away the earth; again the remains were exposed to view,
and lay bleaching in the sun for a quarter of a century.
Travellers stopped to gaze, to moralize, and to pilfer;
postilions and poets scraped off skulls and thigh-bones....
At last, in 1822, the vestiges were swept together and resepulchred,
and a simple obelisk of marble was erected, to
commemorate a victory well deserving of its fame as a
military exploit, but all unworthy to be ranked with earlier
triumphs, won by hands pure as well as strong, defending
freedom and the right."&mdash;<i>History of Charles the Bold</i>, by
J. F. Kirk, 1868, iii. 404, 405.</p>

As a Roman colony it bore the name of <i>Pia Flavia Constans

Infelicis patris, infelix proles. De&aelig; Aventi&aelig; Sacerdos.
Exorare patris necem non potui: Male mori in fatis ille
erat. Vixi annos XXIII."&mdash;I know of no human composition
so affecting as this, nor a history of deeper interest. These
are the names and actions which ought not to perish, and to
which we turn with a true and healthy tenderness, from the
wretched and glittering detail of a confused mass of conquests
and battles, with which the mind is roused for a time
to a false and feverish sympathy, from whence it recurs at
length with all the nausea consequent on such intoxication.</p>

<p>[A mutinous outbreak among the Helvetii, which had been
provoked by the dishonest rapacity of the twenty-first legion,
was speedily quelled by the Roman general Aulus C&aelig;cina.
Aventicum surrendered (A.D. 69), but Julius Alpinus, a
chieftain and supposed ring-leader, was singled out for punishment
and put to death. "The rest," says Tacitus, "were
left to the ruth or ruthlessness of Vitellius"
(<i>Histor</i>., i. 67, 68).
Julia Alpinula and her epitaph were the happy inventions
of a sixteenth-century scholar. "It appears," writes Lord
Stanhope, "that this inscription was given by one Paul
Wilhelm, a noted forger (<i>falsarius</i>), to Lipsius, and by
Lipsius handed over to Gruterus. Nobody, either before
or since Wilhelm, has even pretended to have seen the stone ... as
to any son or daughter of Julius Alpinus, history is
wholly silent" (<i>Quarterly Review</i>, June, 1846, vol. lviii. p. 61;

<p>This refers to the account, in his <i>Confessions</i>, of his
passion for the Comtesse d'Houdetot (the mistress of St.
Lambert), and his long walk every morning, for the sake of
the single kiss which was the common salutation of French
acquaintance. Rousseau's description of his feelings on this
occasion may be considered as the most passionate, yet not
impure, description and expression of love that ever kindled
into words; which, after all, must be felt, from their very
force, to be inadequate to the delineation; a painting can
give no sufficient idea of the ocean.</p>

<p>[Here is Rousseau's "passionate, yet not impure," description
of his sensations: "J'ai dit qu'il y avoit loin de l'Hermitage
&agrave; Eaubonne; je passois par les coteaux d'Andilly qui sont
charmans. Je r&ecirc;vois en marchant &agrave; celle que j'allois voir, &agrave;
l'accueil caressant qu'elle me feroit, au baiser qui m'attendoit
a mon arriv&eacute;e. Ce seul baiser, ce baiser funeste avant m&ecirc;me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
de le recevoir, m'embrasoit le sang &agrave; tel point, que ma t&ecirc;te
se troubloit, un &eacute;blouissement m'aveugloit, mes genoux tremblants
ne pouroient me soutenir; j'&eacute;tois forc&eacute; de m'arr&eacute;ter,
de m'asseoir; toute ma machine &eacute;toit dans un d&eacute;sordre
inconcevable; j'&eacute;tois pr&ecirc;t &agrave; m'&eacute;vanouir.... A l'instant que
je la voyois, tout &eacute;toit r&eacute;par&eacute;; je ne sentois plus aupr&egrave;s d'elle
que l'importunit&eacute; d'une vigueur in&eacute;puisable et toujours
inutile."&mdash;<i>Les Confessions</i>, Partie II. livre ix.;
<i>Oeuvres Compl&egrave;tes de J.J. Rousseau</i>, 1837, i. 233.</p>

<p>Byron's mother "would have it" that her son was like
Rousseau, but he disclaimed the honour antithetically and
with needless particularity (see his letter to Mrs. Byron, and
a quotation from his <i>Detached Thoughts, Letters</i>, 1898, i.
192, note). There was another point of unlikeness, which he
does not mention. Byron, on the passion of love, does not
"make for morality," but he eschews nastiness. The loves of
Don Juan and Haid&eacute;e are chaste as snow compared with
the unspeakable philanderings of the elderly Jean Jacques
and the "mistress of St. Lambert."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, his mother was right. There was a resemblance,
and consequently an affinity, between Childe Burun
and the "visionary of Geneva"&mdash;delineated by another seer
or visionary as "the dreamer of love-sick tales, and the
spinner of speculative cobwebs; shy of light as the mole,
but as quick-eared too for every whisper of the public
opinion; the teacher of Stoic pride in his principles, yet the
victim of morbid vanity in his feelings and
conduct."&mdash;<i>The Friend</i>; <i>Works</i> of S. T.
Coleridge, 1853, ii. 124.]</p>

<p>It is to be recollected, that the most beautiful and impressive
doctrines of the divine Founder of Christianity were
delivered, not in the <i>Temple</i>, but on the <i>Mount</i>. To waive
the question of devotion, and turn to human eloquence,&mdash;the
most effectual and splendid specimens were not pronounced
within walls. Demosthenes addressed the public and
popular assemblies. Cicero spoke in the forum. That this
added to their effect on the mind of both orator and hearers,
may be conceived from the difference between what we read
of the emotions then and there produced, and those we ourselves
experience in the perusal in the closet. It is one thing
to read the <i>Iliad</i> at Sig&aelig;um and on the tumuli, or by the
springs with Mount Ida above, and the plain and rivers and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Archipelago around you; and another to trim your taper
over it in a snug library&mdash;<i>this</i> I know. Were the early and
rapid progress of what is called Methodism to be attributed
to any cause beyond the enthusiasm excited by its vehement
faith and doctrines (the truth or error of which I presume
neither to canvass nor to question), I should venture to
ascribe it to the practice of preaching in the <i>fields</i>, and the
unstudied and extemporaneous effusions of its teachers. The
Mussulmans, whose erroneous devotion (at least in the lower
orders) is most sincere, and therefore impressive, are accustomed
to repeat their prescribed orisons and prayers, wherever
they may be, at the stated hours&mdash;of course, frequently
in the open air, kneeling upon a light mat (which they carry
for the purpose of a bed or cushion as required); the ceremony
lasts some minutes, during which they are totally
absorbed, and only living in their supplication: nothing can
disturb them. On me the simple and entire sincerity of these
men, and the spirit which appeared to be within and upon
them, made a far greater impression than any general rite
which was ever performed in places of worship, of which I
have seen those of almost every persuasion under the sun;
including most of our own sectaries, and the Greek, the
Catholic, the Armenian, the Lutheran, the Jewish, and the
Mahometan. Many of the negroes, of whom there are
numbers in the Turkish empire, are idolaters, and have free
exercise of their belief and its rites; some of these I had a
distant view of at Patras; and, from what I could make out
of them, they appeared to be of a truly Pagan description,
and not very agreeable to a spectator.</p>

<p>[For this profession of "natural piety," compare Rousseau's
<i>Confessions</i>, Partie II. livre xii.
(<i>Oeuvres Compl&egrave;tes</i>, 1837, i. 341)&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Je ne trouve pas de plus digne hommage &agrave; la Divinit&eacute;

villes, qui ne voient que des murs, des rues et des crimes,

[P. I. liv. 4, <i>Oeuvres, etc.</i>, 1837, i. 78].&mdash;In July [June 23-27],
1816, I made a voyage round the Lake of Geneva;<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and, as
far as my own observations have led me in a not uninterested
nor inattentive survey of all the scenes most celebrated by
Rousseau in his <i>H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</i>, I can safely say, that in this there
is no exaggeration. It would be difficult to see Clarens
(with the scenes around it, Vevay, Chillon, B&ocirc;veret, St. Gingo,
Meillerie, Evian,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> and the entrances of the Rhone) without
being forcibly struck with its peculiar adaptation to the
persons and events with which it has been peopled. But
this is not all; the feeling with which all around Clarens,
and the opposite rocks of Meillerie, is invested, is of a still
higher and more comprehensive order than the mere sympathy
with individual passion; it is a sense of the existence
of love in its most extended and sublime capacity, and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
our own participation of its good and of its glory: it is the
great principle of the universe, which is there more condensed,
but not less manifested; and of which, though
knowing ourselves a part, we lose our individuality, and
mingle in the beauty of the whole.&mdash;If Rousseau had never
written, nor lived, the same associations would not less have
belonged to such scenes. He has added to the interest of
his works by their adoption; he has shown his sense of their
beauty by the selection; but they have done that for him
which no human being could do for them.&mdash;I had the fortune
(good or evil as it might be) to sail from Meillerie<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> (where we
landed for some time) to St. Gingo during a lake storm,
which added to the magnificence of all around, although
occasionally accompanied by danger to the boat, which was
small and overloaded. It was over this very part of the
lake that Rousseau has driven the boat of St. Preux and
Madame Wolmar to Meillerie for shelter during a tempest.
On gaining the shore at St. Gingo, I found that the wind had
been sufficiently strong to blow down some fine old chestnut
trees on the lower part of the mountains. On the opposite
height of Clarens is a ch&acirc;teau<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> [Ch&acirc;teau des Cr&ecirc;tes]. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
hills are covered with vineyards, and interspersed with some
small but beautiful woods; one of these was named the
"Bosquet de Julie;" and it is remarkable that, though long
ago cut down by the brutal selfishness of the monks of St.
Bernard (to whom the land appertained), that the ground
might be enclosed into a vineyard for the miserable drones
of an execrable superstition, the inhabitants of Clarens still
point out the spot where its trees stood, calling it by the name
which consecrated and survived them. Rousseau has not
been particularly fortunate in the preservation of the "local
habitations" he has given to "airy nothings." The Prior of
Great St. Bernard has cut down some of his woods for the
sake of a few casks of wine, and Buonaparte has levelled
part of the rocks of Meillerie in improving the road to the
Simplon. The road is an excellent one; but I cannot quite
agree with a remark which I heard made, that "La route
vaut mieux que les souvenirs."</p>

<p>Voltaire and Gibbon.</p>

<p>[Fran&ccedil;ois Marie Arouet de Voltaire (1694-1778) lived on
his estate at Fernex, five miles north of Geneva, from
1759 to 1777. "In the garden at Fernex is a long <i>berceau</i>
walk, closely arched over with clipped horn-beam&mdash;a verdant
cloister, with gaps cut here and there, admitting a glimpse of
the prospect. Here Voltaire used to walk up and down, and
dictate to his secretary."&mdash;<i>Handbook for Switzerland</i>, p. 174.</p>

<p>Previous to this he had lived for some time at Lausanne,
at "Monrepos, a country house at the end of a suburb," at
Monrion, "a square building of two storeys, and a high
garret, with wings, each fashioned like the letter L," and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
afterwards, in the spring of 1757, at No. 6, Rue du Grand
Ch&ecirc;ne.&mdash;<i>Historic Studies</i>, ii. 210, 218, 219.</p>

<p>Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) finished (1788) <i>The Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> at "La Grotte, an ancient
and spacious mansion behind the church of St. Francis, at
Lausanne," which was demolished by the Swiss authorities in
1879. Not only has the mansion ceased to exist, but the
garden has been almost entirely changed. The wall of the
H&ocirc;tel Gibbon occupies the site of the famous wooden
pavilion, or summer-house, and of the "berceau of plum trees,
which formed a verdant gallery completely arched overhead,"
and which "were called after Gibbon,
La Gibboni&egrave;re."&mdash;<i>Historic Studies</i>, i. I; ii. 493.</p>

<p>In 1816 the pavilion was "utterly decayed," and the
garden neglected, but Byron gathered "a sprig of <i>Gibbon's
acacia</i>," and some rose leaves from his garden and enclosed
them in a letter to Murray (June 27, 1816). Shelley, on the
contrary, "refrained from doing so, fearing to outrage the
greater and more sacred name of Rousseau; the contemplation
of whose imperishable creations had left no vacancy
in my heart for mortal things. Gibbon had a cold and
unimpassioned spirit."&mdash;<i>Essays, etc.</i>, 1840, ii. 76.]</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_FOURTH" id="INTRODUCTION_FOURTH"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO THE FOURTH CANTO.
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first draft of the Fourth Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, which
embodies the original and normal conception of the poem,
was the work of twenty-six days. On the 17th of June, 1817,
Byron wrote to Murray: "You are out about the Third
Canto: I have not done, nor designed, a line of continuation
to that poem. I was too short a time at Rome for it, and
have no thought of recommencing." But in spite of this
assertion, "the numbers came," and on June 26 he made a
beginning. Thirty stanzas "were roughened off" on the 1st
of July, fifty-six were accomplished by the 9th, "ninety and
eight" by the 13th, and on July 20 he announces "the completion
of the fourth and ultimate canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>.
It consists of 126 stanzas." One stanza (xl.) was appended
to the fair copy. It suggested a parallel between Ariosto
"the Southern Scott," and Scott "the Northern Ariosto,"
and excited some misgiving.</p>

<p>In commending his new poem to Murray (July 20, August 7),
Byron notes three points in which it differed from its predecessors:
it is "the longest of the four;" "it treats more
of works of art than of nature;" "there are no metaphysics
in it&mdash;at least, I think not." In other words, "The Fourth
Canto is not a continuation of the Third. I have parted
company with Shelley and Wordsworth. Subject-matter and
treatment are alike new."</p>

<p>The poem as it stood was complete, and, as a poem, it
lost as well as gained by the insertion of additional stanzas
and groups of stanzas, "purple patch" on "purple patch,"
each by itself so attractive and so splendid. The pilgrim
finds himself at Venice, on the "Bridge of Sighs." He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
beholds in a vision the departed glories of "a thousand years."
The "long array of shadows," the "beings of the mind,"
come to him "like truth," and repeople the vacancy.
But he is an exile, and turns homeward in thought to "the
inviolate island of the sage and free." He is an exile and a
sufferer. He can and will endure his fate, but "ever and
anon" he feels the prick of woe, and with the sympathy of
despair would stand "a ruin amidst ruins," a desolate soul
in a land of desolation and decay. He renews his pilgrimage.
He passes Arqu&agrave;, where "they keep the dust of Laura's
lover," lingers for a day at Ferrara, haunted by memories of
"Torquato's injured shade," and, as he approaches "the fair
white walls" of Florence, he re-echoes the "Italia! oh, Italia!"
of Filicaja's impassioned strains. At Florence he gazes,
"dazzled and drunk with beauty," at the "goddess in stone,"
the Medicean Venus, but forbears to "describe the indescribable,"
to break the silence of Art by naming its mysteries.
Santa Croce and the other glories "in Arno's dome
of Art's most princely shrine," he passes by unsung, if not
unseen; but Thrasymene's "sheet of silver," the "living
crystal" of Clitumnus' "gentlest waters," and Terni's "matchless
cataract," on whose verge "an Iris sits," and "lone
Soracte's ridge," not only call forth his spirit's homage, but
receive the homage of his Muse.</p>

<p>And now the Pilgrim has reached his goal, "Rome the
wonderful," the sepulchre of empire, the shrine of art.</p>

<p>Henceforth the works of man absorb his attention. Pompey's
"dread statue;" the Wolf of the Capitol; the Tomb of
Cecilia Metella; the Palatine; the "nameless column" of
the Forum; Trajan's pillar; Egeria's Grotto; the ruined
Colosseum, "arches on arches," an "enormous skeleton,"
the Colosseum of the poet's vision, a multitudinous ring of
spectators, a bloody Circus, and a dying Gladiator; the
Pantheon; S. Nicola in Carcere, the scene of the Romana
Caritas; St. Peter's "vast and wondrous dome,"&mdash;are all celebrated
in due succession. Last of all, he "turns to the
Vatican," to view the Laocoon and the Apollo Belvidere,
the counterfeit presentments of ideal suffering and ideal
beauty. His "shrine is won;" but ere he bids us farewell
he climbs the Alban Mount, and as the Mediterranean once
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
more bursts upon his sight, he sums the moral of his argument.
Man and all his works are as a drop of rain in the
Ocean, "the image of eternity, the throne of the Invisible"!</p>

<p>Byron had no sooner completed "this fourth and ultimate
canto," than he began to throw off additional stanzas. His
letters to Murray during the autumn of 1817 announce these
successive lengthenings; but it is impossible to trace the
exact order of their composition. On the 7th of August the
canto stood at 130 stanzas, on the 21st at 133; on the 4th of
September at 144, on the 17th at 150; and by November 15 it
had reached 167 stanzas. Of nineteen stanzas which were
still to be added, six&mdash;on the death of the Princess Charlotte
(died November 6, 1817)&mdash;were written at the beginning of
December, and two stanzas (clxxvii., clxxviii.) were forwarded
to Murray in the early spring of 1818.</p>

<p>Of these additions the most notable are four stanzas on
Venice (including stanza xiii. on "The Horses of St. Mark");
"The sunset on the Brenta" (stanzas xxvii.-xxix.);
The tombs in Santa Croce,&mdash;the apostrophe to
"the all Etruscan three," Petrarch, Dante, Boccaccio (stanzas liv.-lx.);
"Rome a chaos of ruins&mdash;antiquarian ignorance" (stanzas lxxx.-lxxxii.);
"The nothingness of Man&mdash;the hope of the future&mdash;Freedom" (stanzas xciii.-xcviii.);
"The Tarpeian Rock&mdash;the Forum&mdash;Rienzi" (stanzas cxii.-cxiv.);
"Love, Life, and Reason" (stanzas cxx.-cxxvii.);
"The Curse of Forgiveness" (stanzas cxxxv.-cxxxvii.);
"The Mole of Hadrian" (stanza clii.);
"The death of the Princess Charlotte" (stanzas clxvii.-clxxii.);
"Nemi" (stanzas clxxiii., clxxiv.);
"The Desert and one fair Spirit" (stanzas clxxvii., clxxviii.).</p>

<p>Some time during the month of December, 1817, Byron
wrote out a fair copy of the entire canto, numbering 184
stanzas <i>(MS. D.)</i>; and on January 7, 1818, Hobhouse left
Venice for England, with the "whole of the MSS.," viz.
<i>Beppo</i> (begun October, 1817), and the Fourth Canto of
<i>Childe Harold</i>, together with a work of his own,
a volume of essays on Italian literature, the antiquities of Rome,
etc., which he
had put together during his residence in Venice (July&mdash;December, 1817),
and proposed to publish as an appendix
to <i>Childe Harold</i>.
In his preface to <i>Historical Illustrations</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
etc., 1818, Hobhouse explains that on his return to England
he considered that this "appendix to the Canto would be
swelled to a disproportioned bulk," and that, under this impression,
he determined to divide his material into two parts.
The result was that "such only of the notes as were more
immediately connected with the text" were printed as "Historical
Notes to Canto the Fourth," and that his longer
dissertations were published in a separate volume, under his
own name, as <i>Historical Illustrations to the Fourth Canto
of Childe Harold</i>. To these "Historical Notes" an interest
attaches apart from any consideration of their own worth
and importance; but to understand the relation between the
poem and the notes, it is necessary to retrace the movements
of the poet and his annotator.</p>

<p>Byron and Hobhouse left the Villa Diodati, October 5,
1816, crossed the Simplon, and made their way together, via
Milan and Verona, to Venice. Early in December the
friends parted company. Byron remained at Venice, and
Hobhouse proceeded to Rome, and for the next four
months devoted himself to the study of Italian literature, in
connection with arch&aelig;ology and art. Byron testifies (September
14, 1817) that his researches were "indefatigable,"
that he had "more real knowledge of Rome and its environs
than any Englishman who has been there since Gibbon."
Hobhouse left Rome for Naples, May 21; returned to Rome,
June 9; arrived at Terni, July 2; and early in July joined
Byron on the Brenta, at La Mira. The latter half of the
year (July&mdash;December, 1817) was occupied in consulting
"the best authorities" in the Ducal Library at Venice, with
a view to perfecting his researches, and giving them to the
world as an illustrative appendix to <i>Childe Harold</i>. It is
certain that Byron had begun the fourth canto, and written
some thirty or more stanzas, before Hobhouse rejoined him
at his villa of La Mira on the banks of the Brenta, in July,
1817; and it would seem that, although he had begun by
saying "that he was too short a time in Rome for it," he
speedily overcame his misgivings, and accomplished, as he
believed, the last "fytte" of his pilgrimage. The first draft was
Byron's unaided composition, but the "additional stanzas"
were largely due to Hobhouse's suggestions in the course of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
conversation, if not to his written "researches." Hobhouse
himself made no secret of it. In his preface (p. 5) to
<i>Historical Illustrations</i> he affirms that both "illustrations"
and notes were "for the most part written while the noble
author was yet employed in the composition of the poem.
They were put into the hands of Lord Byron much in the
state in which they now appear;" and, writing to Murray,
December 7, 1817, he says, "I must confess I feel an affection
for it [Canto IV.] more than ordinary, as part of it was
begot as it were under my own eyes; for although your
poets are as shy as elephants and camels ... yet I
have, not unfrequently, witnessed his lordship's coupleting,
and some of the stanzas owe their birth to our morning walk
or evening ride at La Mira." Forty years later, in his
revised and enlarged "Illustrations" (<i>Italy: Remarks made
in Several Visits from the year 1816 to 1854</i>, by the Right
Hon. Lord Broughton, G.C.B., 1859, i. p. iv.), he reverts to
this collaboration: "When I rejoined Lord Byron at La
Mira ... I found him employed upon the Fourth Canto of
<i>Childe Harold</i>, and, later in the autumn, he showed me the
first sketch of the poem. It was much shorter than it afterwards
became, and it did not remark on several objects
which appeared to me peculiarly worthy of notice. I made
a list of these objects, and in conversation with him gave
him reasons for the selection. The result was the poem as
it now appears, and he then engaged me to write the notes."</p>

<p>As the "delicate spirit" of Shelley suffused the third canto
of <i>Childe Harold</i>, so the fourth reveals the presence and
co-operation of Hobhouse. To his brother-poet he owed a
fresh conception, perhaps a fresh appreciation of nature; to
his lifelong friend, a fresh enthusiasm for art, and a host of
details, "dry bones ... which he awakened into the fulness of life."</p>

<p>The Fourth Canto was published on Tuesday, April 28, 1818.
It was reviewed by [Sir] Walter Scott in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, No. xxxvii., April, 1818,
and by John Wilson in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, No. 59, June, 1818.
Both numbers were
published on the same day, September 26, 1818.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p class="attrib"><span class="smcap">Venice</span>, <i>January</i> 2, 1818.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Hobhouse</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">After</span> an interval of eight years between the
composition of the first and last cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i>,
the conclusion of the poem is about to be submitted to the
public. In parting with so old a friend,<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> it is not extraordinary
that I should recur to one still older and better,&mdash;to
one who has beheld the birth and death of the other, and
to whom I am far more indebted for the social advantages
of an enlightened friendship, than&mdash;though not ungrateful&mdash;I
can, or could be, to <i>Childe Harold</i>, for any public favour
reflected through the poem on the poet,&mdash;to one, whom I
have known long, and accompanied far, whom I have found
wakeful over my sickness and kind in my sorrow, glad in my
prosperity and firm in my adversity, true in counsel and
trusty in peril,&mdash;to a friend often tried and never found
wanting;&mdash;to yourself.</p>


<p>In so doing, I recur from fiction to truth; and in dedicating
to you in its complete, or at least concluded state, a
poetical work which is the longest, the most thoughtful and
comprehensive of my compositions, I wish to do honour to
myself by the record of many years' intimacy with a man of
learning, of talent, of steadiness, and of honour. It is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for minds like ours to give or to receive flattery; yet the
praises of sincerity have ever been permitted to the voice of
friendship; and it is not for you, nor even for others, but to
relieve a heart which has not elsewhere, or lately, been so
much accustomed to the encounter of good-will as to withstand
the shock firmly, that I thus attempt to commemorate
your good qualities, or rather the advantages which I have
derived from their exertion. Even the recurrence of the
date of this letter, the anniversary of the most unfortunate
day of my past existence,<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> but which cannot poison my
future while I retain the resource of your friendship, and of
my own faculties, will henceforth have a more agreeable
recollection for both, inasmuch as it will remind us of this
my attempt to thank you for an indefatigable regard, such
as few men have experienced, and no one could experience
without thinking better of his species and of himself.</p>


<p>It has been our fortune to traverse together, at various
periods, the countries of chivalry, history, and fable&mdash;Spain,
Greece, Asia Minor, and Italy; and what Athens and Constantinople
were to us a few years ago, Venice and Rome
have been more recently. The poem also, or the pilgrim, or
both, have accompanied me from first to last; and perhaps
it may be a pardonable vanity which induces me to reflect
with complacency on a composition which in some degree
connects me with the spot where it was produced, and the
objects it would fain describe; and however unworthy it
may be deemed of those magical and memorable abodes,
however short it may fall of our distant conceptions and
immediate impressions, yet as a mark of respect for what is
venerable, and of feeling for what is glorious, it has been to
me a source of pleasure in the production, and I part with it
with a kind of regret, which I hardly suspected that events
could have left me for imaginary objects.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to the conduct of the last canto, there will be
found less of the pilgrim than in any of the preceding, and
that little slightly, if at all, separated from the author
speaking in his own person. The fact is, that I had become
weary of drawing a line which every one seemed determined
not to perceive: like the Chinese in Goldsmith's <i>Citizen of
the World</i>,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> whom nobody would believe to be a Chinese, it
was in vain that I asserted, and imagined that I had drawn,
a distinction between the author and the pilgrim; and the
very anxiety to preserve this difference, and disappointment
at finding it unavailing, so far crushed my efforts in the
composition, that I determined to abandon it altogether&mdash;and
have done so. The opinions which have been, or may
be, formed on that subject are <i>now</i> a matter of indifference:
the work is to depend on itself, and not on the writer; and
the author, who has no resources in his own mind beyond the
reputation, transient or permanent, which is to arise from his
literary efforts, deserves the fate of authors.</p>

<p>In the course of the following canto it was my intention,
either in the text or in the notes, to have touched upon the
present state of Italian literature, and perhaps of manners.
But the text, within the limits I proposed, I soon found
hardly sufficient for the labyrinth of external objects, and the
consequent reflections: and for the whole of the notes,
excepting a few of the shortest, I am indebted to yourself,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>
and these were necessarily limited to the elucidation of the text.</p>


<p>It is also a delicate, and no very grateful task, to dissert
upon the literature and manners of a nation so dissimilar;
and requires an attention and impartiality which would
induce us,&mdash;though perhaps no inattentive observers, nor
ignorant of the language or customs of the people amongst
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
whom we have recently abode&mdash;to distrust, or at least defer
our judgment, and more narrowly examine our information.
The state of literary, as well as political party, appears to
run, or to <i>have</i> run, so high, that for a stranger to steer
impartially between them is next to impossible. It may be
enough, then, at least for my purpose, to quote from their
own beautiful language&mdash;"Mi pare che in un paese tutto
poetico, che vanta la lingua la pi&ugrave; nobile ed insieme la pi&ugrave;
dolce, tutte tutte le vie diverse si possono tentare, e che
sinche la patria di Alfieri e di Monti non ha perduto l'antico
valore, in tutte essa dovrebbe essere la prima." Italy has
great names still&mdash;Canova,<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> Monti, Ugo Foscolo, Pindemonte,
Visconti, Morelli, Cicognara, Albrizzi, Mezzofanti,
Mai, Mustoxidi, Aglietti, and Vacca, will secure to the
present generation an honourable place in most of the
departments of Art, Science, and Belles Lettres; and in
some the very highest&mdash;Europe&mdash;the World&mdash;has but one Canova.</p>


<p>It has been somewhere said by Alfieri, that "La pianta
uomo nasce pi&ugrave; robusta in Italia che in qualunque altra
terra&mdash;e che gli stessi atroci delitti che vi si commettono ne
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
sono una prova." Without subscribing to the latter part of
his proposition, a dangerous doctrine, the truth of which
may be disputed on better grounds, namely, that the Italians
are in no respect more ferocious than their neighbours, that
man must be wilfully blind, or ignorantly heedless, who is
not struck with the extraordinary capacity of this people, or,
if such a word be admissible, their <i>capabilities</i>,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
the facility of
their acquisitions, the rapidity of their conceptions, the fire
of their genius, their sense of beauty, and, amidst all the
disadvantages of repeated revolutions, the desolation of
battles, and the despair of ages, their still unquenched
"longing after immortality,"<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>&mdash;the immortality of independence.
And when we ourselves, in riding round the walls of
Rome, heard the simple lament of the labourers' chorus,
"Roma! Roma! Roma! Roma non &egrave; pi&ugrave; come era prima!"<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
it was difficult not to contrast this melancholy dirge with the
bacchanal roar of the songs of exultation still yelled from
the London taverns, over the carnage of Mont St. Jean,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> and
the betrayal of Genoa, of Italy, of France, and of the world,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
by men whose conduct you yourself have exposed in a work
worthy of the better days of our history.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> For me,&mdash;</p>

<p>What Italy has gained by the late transfer of nations, it
were useless for Englishmen to enquire, till it becomes ascertained
that England has acquired something more than a
permanent army and a suspended Habeas Corpus;<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> it is
enough for them to look at home. For what they have done
abroad, and especially in the South, "Verily they <i>will have</i>
their reward," and at no very distant period.</p>

<p>Wishing you, my dear Hobhouse, a safe and agreeable
return to that country whose real welfare can be dearer to
none than to yourself, I dedicate to you this poem in its

republic, which is the origin of the word Pantaloon&mdash;Piantaleone,
Pantaleon, Pantaloon.
</p><p>
[The Venetians were nicknamed Pantaloni. Byron, who seems to have relied
on the authority of a Venetian glossary, assumes that the "by-word" may
be traced to the patriotism of merchant-princes "who were reputed to
hoist flags with the Venetian lion waving to the breeze on every rock
and barren headland of Levantine waters" (<i>Memoirs of Count Carlo
Gozzi</i>, translated by J. Addington Symonds, 1890, Introd. part ii. p.
44), and that in consequence of this spread-eagleism the Venetians were
held up to scorn by their neighbours as "planters of the lion"&mdash;a
reproach which conveyed a tribute to their prowess. A more probable
explanation is that the "by-word," with its cognates "Pantaleone," the
typical masque of Italian comedy&mdash;progenitor of our "Pantaloon;" and
"pantaloni," "pantaloons," the typical Venetian costume&mdash;derive their
origin from the baptismal name "Pantaleone," frequently given to
Venetian children, in honour of St. Pantaleon of Nicomedia, physician
and martyr, whose cult was much in vogue in Northern Italy, and
especially in Venice, where his relics, which "coruscated with
miracles," were the object of peculiar veneration.
</p><p>
St. Pantaleon was known to the Greek Church as
<span title="Pantele&ecirc;/m&ocirc;n">&#928;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#8053;&#956;&#969;&#957;</span>,
that is, the "all-pitiful;" and in Latin his name is
spelled <i>Pantaleymon</i> and <i>Pantaleemon</i>. Hagiologists seem to have been
puzzled, but the compiler of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i>, for July 27, St.
Pantaleon's Day in the Roman calendar (xxxiii. 397-426), gives the
preference to Pantaleon, and explains that he was hailed as Pantaleemon
by a divine voice at the hour of his martyrdom, which proclaimed "eum
non amplius esse vocandum Pantaleonem, sed Pantaleemonem."

[For <i>Venice Preserved</i>, <i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Footnote_383">stanza iv. line 7, note</a>.
To the <i>Mysteries of Udolpho</i> Byron was indebted for more than one suggestion,
<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Footnote_377">stanza i. line 4, note</a>, and <i>Mysteries, etc.</i>, London,
1794, 2. 39: "The air bore no sounds, but those of sweetness echoing
along each margin of the canal and from gondolas on its surface, while
groups of masks were seen dancing on the moonlit terraces, and seemed
almost to realize the romance of fairy-land." The scene of Schiller's
<i>Der Geisterseher</i> (<i>Werke</i>, 1819, x. 97, <i>sq.</i>) is laid at Venice.
"This [the Doge's palace] was the thing that most struck my imagination
in Venice&mdash;more than the Rialto, which I visited for the sake of
Shylock; and more, too, than Schiller's <i>Armenian</i>, a novel which took a
great hold of me when a boy. It is also called the <i>Ghost Seer</i>, and I
never walked down St. Mark's by moonlight without thinking of it, and
'at nine o'clock he died!' [For allusion to the same incident, see
Rogers's <i>Italy</i> (<i>Poems</i>, 1852, ii. 73).] But I hate things <i>all
fiction</i>; and therefore the <i>Merchant</i> and <i>Othello</i> have no great
associations for me: but <i>Pierre</i> has."&mdash;Letter to Murray, Venice, April
2, 1817. (For an earlier reference to the <i>Ghost-seer</i>, see <i>Oscar of

<i>Tannen</i> is the plural of <i>tanne</i>, a species of fir
peculiar to the Alps, which only thrives in very rocky parts, where
scarcely soil sufficient for its nourishment can be found. On these
spots it grows to a greater height than any other mountain tree.
</p><p>
[Byron did not "know German" (Letter to Murray, June 7, 1820), and he
may, as Mr. Tozer suggests, have supposed that the word "tannen" denoted
not "fir trees" generally, but a particular kind of fir tree. He refers,
no doubt, to the Ebeltanne (<i>Abies pectinata</i>), which is not a native of
this country, but grows at a great height on the Swiss Alps and
throughout the mountainous region of Central Europe.]</p></div>

of Epicurus, that a great sorrow is necessarily of short duration, a
prolonged sorrow necessarily light: "Quod autem magnum dolorem brevem
longinquum levem esse dicitis, id non intelligo quale sit, video enim et
magnos et eosdem bene longinquos dolores." But the sentiment is adopted
by Montaigne (1. xiv.), ed. 1580, p. 66: "Tu ne la sentiras guiere long
temps, si tu la sens trop; elle mettra fin &agrave; soy ou &agrave; toy; l'un et
l'autre revient a un." ("Si tu ne la portes; elle t'emportera," note.)
And again by Sir Thomas Brown, "Sense endureth no extremities, and
sorrows destroy us or themselves" (see Darmesteter, <i>Childe Harold</i>,
1882, p. 193). Byron is not refining upon these conceits, but is drawing
upon his own experience. Suffering which does not kill is subject to
change, and "continueth not in one stay;" but it remains within call,
and returns in an hour when we are not aware.]</p></div>

P&eacute;trarque</i> (1767), affirmed, on the strength of documentary evidence,
that the Laura of the sonnets, born de Noves, was the wife of his
ancestor, Hugo de Sade, and the mother of a large family. "Gibbon," says
Hobhouse (<a href="#en_4_8">note viii</a>.), "called the abb&eacute;'s memoirs a 'labour of love'
(see <i>Decline and Fall</i>, chap. lxx. note 1), and followed him with
confidence and delight;" but the poet James Beattie (in a letter to the
Duchess of Gordon, August 17, 1782) disregarded them as a "romance,"
and, more recently, "an ingenious Scotchman" [Alexander Fraser Tytler
(Lord Woodhouselee)], in an <i>Historical and Critical Essay on the Life
and Character of Petrarch</i> (1810), had re-established "the ancient
prejudice" in favour of Laura's virginity. Hobhouse appears, but his
note is somewhat ambiguous, to adopt the view of "the ingenious
Scotchman." To pass to contemporary criticism, Dr. Garnett, in his
<i>History of Italian Literature</i>, 1898 (pp. 66-71), without attempting to
settle "the everlasting controversy," regards the abb&eacute;'s documentary
evidence as for the most part worthless, and, relying on the internal
evidence of the sonnets and the dialogue, and on the facts of Petrarch's
life as established by his correspondence (a complete series of
Petrarch's letters was published by Giuseppe Fracassetti, in 1859),
inclines to the belief that it was the poet's status as a cleric, and
not a husband and family, which proved a bar to his union with Laura.
With regard, however, to "one piece of documentary evidence," namely,
Laura de Sade's will, Dr. Garnett admits that, if this were producible,
and, on being produced, proved genuine, the coincidence of the date of
the will, April 3, 1348, with a note in Petrarch's handwriting, dated
April 6, 1348, which records the death of Laura, would almost establish
the truth of the abb&eacute;'s theory "in the teeth of all objections."]</p></div>

Azzo V. was the first who obtained power in Ferrara in the twelfth
century. A remote descendant, Nicolo III. (b. 1384, d. 1441), founded
the University of Parma. He married for his second wife Parisina
Malatesta (the heroine of Byron's <i>Parisina</i>, published February, 1816),
who was beheaded for adultery in 1425. His three sons, Lionel (d. 1450),
the friend of Poggio Bracciolini; Borso (d. 1471), who established
printing in his states; and Ercolo (d. 1505), the friend of
Boiardo,&mdash;were all patrons of letters and fosterers of the Renaissance.
Their successor, Alphonso I. (1486-1534), who married Lucrezia Borgia,
1502, honoured himself by attaching Ariosto to his court, and it was his
grandson, Alphonso II. (d. 1597), who first befriended and afterwards,
on the score of lunacy, imprisoned Tasso in the Hospital of Sant' Anna
(1579-86).]</p></div>

of the Hospital of Sant' Anna at Ferrara for seven years and four
months&mdash;from March, 1579, to July, 1586&mdash;but the causes, the character,
and the place of his imprisonment have been subjects of legend and
misrepresentation. It has long been known and acknowledged (see
Hobhouse's <i>Historical Illustrations</i>, 1818, pp. 5-31) that a real or
feigned passion for Duke Alphonso's sister, Leonora d'Este, was not the
cause or occasion of his detention, and that the famous cell or dungeon
("nine paces by six, and about seven high") was not "the original place
of the poet's confinement." It was, as Shelley says (see his letter to
Peacock, November 7, 1818), "a very decent dungeon;" but it was not
Tasso's. The setting of the story was admitted to be legendary, but the
story itself, that a poet was shut up in a madhouse because a vindictive
magnate resented his love of independence and impatience of courtly
servitude, was questioned, only to be reasserted as historical. The
publication of Tasso's letters by Guasti, in 1853, a review of Tasso's
character and career in Symonds's <i>Renaissance in Italy</i>, and, more
recently, Signor Angelo Solerti's monumental work, <i>Vita di Torquato
Tasso</i> (1895), which draws largely upon the letters of contemporaries,
the accounts of the ducal court, and other documentary evidence, have in
a great measure exonerated the duke at the expense of the unhappy poet
himself. Briefly, Tasso's intrigues with rival powers&mdash;the Medici at
Florence, the papal court, and the Holy Office at Bologna&mdash;aroused the
alarm and suspicion of the duke, whilst his general demeanour and his
outbursts of violence and temper compelled, rather than afforded, a
pretext for his confinement. Before his final and fatal return to
Ferrara, he had been duly warned that he must submit to be treated as a
person of disordered intellect, and that if he continued to throw out
hints of designs upon his life and of persecution in high places, he
would be banished from the ducal court and dominions. But return he
would, and at an inauspicious moment, when the duke was preoccupied with
the ceremonies and festivities of a third marriage. No one attended to
him or took heed of his arrival; and, to quote his own words, "in a fit
of madness" he broke out into execrations of the ducal court and family,
and of the people of Ferrara. For the offence he was shut up in the
Hospital of Sant' Anna, and for many months treated as an ordinary
lunatic. Of the particulars of his treatment during these first eight
months of his confinement, apart from Tasso's own letters, there is no
evidence. The accounts of the hospital are lost, and the <i>Libri di
spesa</i> (<i>R. Arch. di Stato in Modena</i>; <i>Camer. Ducale: Casa</i>;
<i>Amministrazione</i>, Solerti, iii. <i>Docu</i>. 47) do not commence till
November 20, 1579. Two years later, the <i>Libri di spenderia</i> (Solerti,
in. <i>Docu</i>. 51), from January, 1582, onward, show that he was put on a
more generous diet; and it is known that a certain measure of liberty
and other indulgences were gradually accorded. There can, however, be
little doubt that for many months his food was neglected and medical
attendance withheld. His statement, that he was denied the rites of the
Church, cannot be gainsaid. He was regarded as a lunatic, and, as such,
he would not be permitted either to make his confession or to
communicate. Worse than all, there was the terrible solitude. "E sovra
tutto," he writes (May, 1580), "m'affligge la solitudine, mia crudele e
natural nimica." No wonder the attacks of delirium, the "unwonted
lights," the conference with a familiar spirit, followed in due course.
Byron and Shelley were ignorant of the facts; and we know that their
scorn and indignation were exaggerated and misplaced. But the "pity of
it" remains, that the grace and glory of his age was sacrificed to
ignorance and fear, if not to animosity and revenge. (See <i>Tasso</i>, by E.
J. Hasell; <i>History of the Italian Renaissance</i>, by J. A. Symonds;
<i>Quart. Rev.</i>, October, 1895, No. 364, art. x.; <i>Vita di Torquato
Tasso</i>, 1895, i. 312-314, 410-412, etc.)]</p></div>

favour with Alphonso, was responsible for "the opposition which the
Jerusalem encountered from the Cruscan Academy." He assigns their
unfavourable criticism to literary sentiment or prejudice, and not to
personal animosity or intrigue. The <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> was dedicated
to the glory of the house of Este; and, though the poet was in disgrace,
the duke was not to be propitiated by an attack upon the poem. Moreover,
Salviati did not publish his theses in his own name, but under a <i>nom de
guerre</i>, "L'Infarinato."]</p></div>

a hint that Scott might not like being called "the Ariosto of the
North," and Murray seems to have caught at the suggestion. "With regard
to 'the Ariosto of the North,'" rejoins Byron (September 17, 1817),
"surely their themes, Chivalry, war, and love, were as like as can be;
and as to the compliment, if you knew what the Italians think of
Ariosto, you would not hesitate about that.... If you think Scott will
dislike it, say so, and I will expunge." Byron did not know that when
Scott was at college at Edinburgh he had "had the audacity to produce a
composition in which he weighed Homer against Ariosto, and pronounced
him wanting in the balance," or that he "made a practice of reading
through ... the <i>Orlando</i> of Ariosto once every year" (see <i>Memoirs of
the Life, etc.</i>, 1871, pp. 12, 747); but the parallel had suggested
itself. The key-note of "the harpings of the north," the chivalrous
strain of "shield, lance, and brand, and plume and scarf," of "gentle
courtesy," of "valour, lion-mettled lord," which the "Introduction to
<i>Marmion</i>" preludes, had been already struck in the opening lines of the
<i>Orlando Furioso</i>&mdash;

<span class="i0">"Le Donne, i Cavali&eacute;r', l'arme, gli amori,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Le cortes&iacute;e, l'audaci imprese io canto."<br /></span>
</div></div><p>
Scott, we may be assured, was neither disconcerted nor uplifted by the
parallel. Many years before (July 6, 1812), Byron had been at pains to
inform him that so august a critic as the Prince Regent "preferred you
to every bard past and present," and "spoke alternately of Homer and
yourself." Of the "placing" and unplacing of poets there is no end.
Byron had already been sharply rebuked by the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for
describing <i>Christabel</i> as a "wild and singularly original and beautiful
poem," and his appreciation of Scott provoked the expostulation of a
friendlier critic. "Walter Scott," wrote Francis Hodgson, in his
anonymous <i>Monitor of Childe Harold</i> (1818), "(<i>credite posteri</i>, or
rather <i>pr&aelig;posteri</i>), is designated in the Fourth Canto of <i>Childe
Harold</i> as 'the Northern Ariosto,' and (droller still) Ariosto is
denominated 'the Southern Scott.' This comes of mistaking
horse-chestnuts for chestnut horses."]</p></div>

Even while confessing the presence and power of "triumphal Art" in
sculpture, one of "the two most artificial of the Arts" (see his letter
to Murray, April 26, 1817), then first revealed to him at Florence, he
took care that his enthusiasm should not be misunderstood. He had made
bitter fun of the art-talk of collectors, and he was unrepentant, and,
moreover, he was "not careful" to incur a charge of indifference to the
fine arts in general. Among the "crowd" which found their place in his
complex personality, there was "the barbarian," and there was "the
philistine," and there was, too, the humourist who took a subtle
pleasure in proclaiming himself "a plain man," puzzled by subtleties,
and unable to catch the drift of spirits finer than his own.]</p></div>

ideal personages with whom, as he tells us (<i>Life</i>, p. 644), Byron was
wont to be compared. Moore perceives and dwells on the resemblance. A
passage in Alfieri's autobiography (<i>La Vie de V. A. &eacute;crite par
Lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, Paris, 1809, p. 17) may have suggested the parallel&mdash;
</p>

chose, d'une timidit&eacute; excessive, et inflexible quand on voulait me
prendre &agrave; rebours."</p>
</div>
<p>
The resemblance, as Byron admits, "related merely to our apparent
personal dispositions." Both were noble, both were poets, both were
"patrician republicans," and both were lovers of pleasure as well as
lovers and students of literature; but their works do not provoke
comparison. "The quality of 'a narrow elevation' which [Matthew] Arnold
finds in Alfieri," is not characteristic of the author of <i>Childe
Harold</i> and <i>Don Juan</i>.
</p><p>
Of this stanza, however, Alfieri's fine sonnet to Florence may have been
the inspiration. I have Dr. Garnett's permission to cite the following

buried in the Church of S. Francesco. His remains were afterwards
transferred to a mausoleum in the friars' cemetery, on the north side of
the church, which was raised to his memory by his friend and patron,
Guido da Polenta. The mausoleum was restored more than once, and rebuilt
in its present form in 1780, at the cost of Cardinal Luigi Valenti
Gonzaga. On the occasion of Dante's sexcentenary, in 1865, it was
discovered that at some unknown period the skeleton, with the exception
of a few small bones which remained in an urn which formed part of
Gonzaga's structure, had been placed for safety in a wooden box, and
enclosed in a wall of the old Braccioforte Chapel, which lies outside
the church towards the Piazza. "The bones found in the wooden box were
placed in the mausoleum with great pomp and exultation, the poet being
now considered the symbol of a united Italy. The wooden box itself has
been removed to the public library."&mdash;<i>Handbook far Northern Italy</i>, p.

that a recent edict forbidding burial in churches applied to ancient

aside as useless into the adjoining cloisters" (<i>Handbook for Central

bigotry." But it is improbable that the "hy&aelig;na bigots," that is, the
ecclesiastical authorities, were ignorant that Boccaccio was a bitter

speak, out of its confinement, it opens out into a broad basin, so clear
and transparent, that you may count the pebbles and little pieces of
money which are thrown into it.... The banks are clothed with an
abundance of ash and poplar, which are so distinctly reflected in the

Of the time, place, and qualities of this kind of iris,
the reader will see a short account, in a note to <i>Manfred</i>.<a href="#F432_A">[A]</a> The fall
looks so much like "the Hell of waters," that Addison thought the
descent alluded to by the gulf in which Alecto<a href="#F432_B">[B]</a> plunged into the
infernal regions. It is singular enough, that two of the finest cascades
in Europe should be artificial&mdash;this of the Velino, and the one at
Tivoli. The traveller is strongly recommended to trace the Velino, at
least as high as the little lake called <i>Pie' di Lup</i>. The Reatine
territory was the Italian Tempe (Cicer., <i>Epist. ad Attic.</i>, lib. iv.
15), and the ancient naturalists ["In lacu Velino nullo non die apparere
arcus"] (Plin., <i>Hist. Nat.</i>, lib. ii. cap. lxii.), amongst other
beautiful varieties, remarked the daily rainbows of the lake Velinus. A
scholar of great name has devoted a treatise to this district alone. See
Ald. Manut., <i>De Reatina Urb Agroque</i>, ap. Sallengre, <i>Nov. Thes. Ant.

[Byron is again at fault with his German. "Lawine" (see Schiller,
<i>Wilhelm Tell</i>, act iii. sc. 3) signifies an avalanche, not avalanches.
In stanza xii. line 7 a similar mistake occurs. It may seem strange
that, for the sake of local colouring, or for metrical purposes, he
should substitute a foreign equivalent which required a note, for a fine
word already in vogue. But in 1817 "avalanche" itself had not long been
naturalized. Fifty years before, the Italian <i>valanca</i> and <i>valanche</i>
had found their way into books of travel, but "avalanche" appears first
(see <i>N. Eng. Dict.</i>, art. "Avalanche") in 1789, in Coxe's <i>Trav.
Switz.</i>, xxxviii. ii. 3, and in poetry, perhaps, in Wordsworth's
<i>Descriptive Sketches</i>, which were written in 1791-2. Like "ca&ntilde;on" and
"veldt" in our own day, it might be regarded as on probation. But the
fittest has survived, and Byron's unlovely and misbegotten "lauwine" has
died a natural death.]</p></div>

tired of the task before we can comprehend the beauty; that we learn by
rote before we can get by heart; that the freshness is worn away, and
the future pleasure and advantage deadened and destroyed, by the
didactic anticipation, at an age when we can neither feel nor understand
the power of compositions which it requires an acquaintance with life,
as well as Latin and Greek, to relish, or to reason upon. For the same
reason, we never can be aware of the fulness of some of the finest
passages of Shakspeare ("To be or not to be," for instance), from the
habit of having them hammered into us at eight years old, as an
exercise, not of mind, but of memory: so that when we are old enough to
enjoy them, the taste is gone, and the appetite palled. In some parts of
the continent, young persons are taught from more common authors, and do
not read the best classics till their maturity. I certainly do not speak
on this point from any pique or aversion towards the place of my
education. I was not a slow, though an idle boy; and I believe no one
could, or can be, more attached to Harrow than I have always been, and
with reason;&mdash;a part of the time passed there was the happiest of my
life; and my preceptor, the Rev. Dr. Joseph Drury, was the best and
worthiest friend I ever possessed, whose warnings I have remembered but
too well, though too late when I have erred,&mdash;and whose counsels I have
but followed when I have done well or wisely. If ever this imperfect
record of my feelings towards him should reach his eyes, let it remind
him of one who never thinks of him but with gratitude and veneration&mdash;of
one who would more gladly boast of having been his pupil, if, by more
closely following his injunctions, he could reflect any honour upon his
instructor.

When the sarcophagus was opened, in 1780, the skeleton was found to be

detached and removed to the Vatican. Hobhouse (<i>Hist. Illust</i>., pp.

emperors&mdash;Vespasian, Domitian, Septimius Severus&mdash;added to the splendour
of the name-giving Palatine. "The troops of Genseric," says Hobhouse
(<i>Hist. Illust.</i>, p. 206), "occupied the Palatine, and despoiled it of
all its riches... and when it again rises, it rises in ruins."
Systematic excavations during the last fifty years have laid bare much
that was hidden, and "learning and research" have in parts revealed the
"obliterated plan;" but, in 1817, the "shapeless mass of ruins" defied
the guesses of antiquarians. "Your walks in the Palatine ruins ... will
be undisturbed, unless you startle a fox in breaking through the
brambles in the corridors, or burst unawares through the hole of some
shivered fragments into one of the half-buried chambers, which the
peasants have blocked up to serve as stalls for their jackasses, or as
huts for those who watch the gardens" (<i>Hist. Illust.</i>, p. 212).]</p></div>

reflecting on the surprising fate and revolutions of kingdoms; how Rome,
once the mistress of the world, the seat of arts, empire, and glory, now
lies sunk in sloth, ignorance, and poverty; enslaved to the most cruel
as well as to the most contemptible of tyrants, superstition and
religious imposture; while this remote country, anciently the jest and
contempt of the polite Romans, is become the happy seat of liberty,
plenty, and letters; flourishing in all the arts and refinements of
civil life; yet running, perhaps, the same course which Rome itself had
run before it, from virtuous industry to wealth; from wealth to luxury;
from luxury to an impatience of discipline and corruption of morals:
till, by a total degeneracy and loss of virtue, being grown ripe for
destruction, it fall a prey at last to some hardy oppressor, and, with
the loss of liberty, losing everything that is valuable, sinks gradually
again into its original barbarism." (See <i>Life of M. Tullius Cicero</i>, by

which attributes the erection of the column to the Exarch Smaragdus, in

was originally surmounted by a gilded statue, but it is probable that

princes; and it would be easier to find a sovereign uniting exactly the
opposite characteristics, than one possessed of all the happy qualities
ascribed to this emperor. "When he mounted the throne," says the
historian Dion, "he was strong in body, he was vigorous in mind; age had
impaired none of his faculties; he was altogether free from envy and
from detraction; he honoured all the good, and he advanced them: and on
this account they could not be the objects of his fear, or of his hate;
he never listened to informers; he gave not way to his anger; he
abstained equally from unfair exactions and unjust punishments; he had
rather be loved as a man than honoured as a sovereign; he was affable
with his people, respectful to the senate, and universally beloved by
both; he inspired none with dread but the enemies of his country." (See

[M. Ulpius Trajanus (A.D. 52-117) celebrated a triumph over the Dacians
in 103 and 106. It is supposed that the column which stands at the north
end of the Forum Trajanum commemorated the Dacian victories. In 115-16
he conquered the Parthians, and added the province of Armenia Minor to
the empire. It was not, however, an absolute or a final victory. The
little desert stronghold of Atr&aelig;, or Hatra, in Mesopotamia, remained
uncaptured; and, instead of incorporating the Parthians in the empire,
he thought it wiser to leave them to be governed by a native prince
under the suzerainty of Rome. His conquests were surrendered by Hadrian,
and henceforth the tide of victory began to ebb. He died on his way back
to Rome, at Selinus, in Cilicia, in August, 117.
</p><p>
Trajan's "moderation was known unto all men." Pliny, in his
<i>Panegyricus</i> (xxii.), describes his first entry into Rome. He might

afoot, conspicuous, pre-eminent, a head and shoulders above the crowd&mdash;a
triumphal entry; but it was imperial arrogance, not civil liberty, over
which he triumphed. "You were our king," he says, "and we your subjects;
but we obeyed you as the embodiment of our laws." Martial (<i>Epig.</i>, x.
72) hails him not as a tyrant, but an emperor&mdash;yea, more than an
emperor&mdash;as the most righteous of lawgivers and senators, who had
brought back plain Truth to the light of day; and Claudian (viii. 318)
maintains that his glory will live, not because the Parthians had been
annexed, but because he was "mitis patri&aelig;." The divine honours which he
caused to be paid to his adopted father, Nerva, he refused for himself.
"For just reasons," says Pliny, "did the Senate and people of Rome
assign thee the name and title of Optimus." Another honour awaited him:
"Il est seul Empereur," writes M. De La Berge, "dont les restes aient
repos&eacute; dans l'enceinte de la ville Eternelle." (See Pliny's
<i>Panegyricus, passim;</i> and <i>Essai sur le r&egrave;gne de Trajan</i>, Biblioth&egrave;que

temple stand in the citadel?" Excavations which were carried on in
1876-7 by Professors Jordan and Lanciani enabled them to identify with
"tolerable certainty" the site of the central temple and its adjacent
wings, with the site of the Palazzo Caffarelli and its dependencies
which occupy the south-east section of the Mons Capitolinus. There are
still, however, rival Tarpeian Rocks&mdash;one (in the Vicolo della Rupe
Tarpea) on the western edge of the hill facing the Tiber, and the other

Dionysius, who describes the "Traitor's Leap" as being in sight of the

(and other criminals, e.g. "bearers of false witness") were thrown must
have been somewhere on the southern and now less precipitous escarpment
of the mount.]</p></div>

called Cola di' Rienzi, was born in 1313. The son of a Roman innkeeper,
he owed his name and fame to his own talents and natural gifts. His
mission, or, perhaps, ambition, was to free Rome from the tyranny and
oppression of the great nobles, and to establish once more "the good
estate," that is, a republic. This for a brief period Rienzi
accomplished. On May 20, 1347, he was proclaimed tribune and liberator
of the Holy Roman Republic "by the authority of the most merciful Lord
Jesus Christ." Of great parts, and inspired by lofty aims, he was a poor
creature at heart&mdash;a "bastard" Napoleon&mdash;and success seems to have
turned his head. After eight months of royal splendour, purchased by
more than royal exactions, the tide of popular feeling turned against
him, and he was forced to take refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo
(December 15, 1347). Years of wandering and captivity followed his first
tribunate; but at length, in 1354, he was permitted to return to Rome,
and, once again, after a rapid and successful reduction of the
neighbouring states, he became the chief power in the state. But an act
of violence, accompanied by treachery, and, above all, the necessity of
imposing heavier taxes than the city could bear, roused popular
discontent; and during a revolt (October 8, 1354), after a dastardly
attempt to escape and conceal himself, he was recognized by the crowd
and stabbed to death.
</p><p>
Petrarch first made his acquaintance in 1340, when he was summoned to
Rome to be crowned as poet laureate. Afterwards, when Rienzi was
imprisoned at Avignon, Petrarch interceded on his behalf with the pope,
but, for a time, in vain. He believed in and shared his enthusiasms; and
it is probable that the famous Canzone, "Spirto gentil, che quelle
membra reggi," was addressed to the Last of the Tribunes.
</p><p>
Rienzi's story forms the subject of a tragedy by Gustave Drouineau,
which was played at the Od&eacute;on, January 28, 1826; of Bulwer Lytton's
novel <i>The Last of the Tribunes</i>, which was published in 1835; and of an
opera (1842) by Richard Wagner.

attempt is made to trace a minute resemblance between the characters and
careers of Rienzi and the First Napoleon.)]</p></div>

Egeria, which is situated a little to the left of the Via Appia, about
two miles to the south-east of the Porta di Sebastiano: "Here, beside
the Almo rivulet [now the Maranna d. Caffarella], is a ruined nymph&aelig;um
... which was called the 'Grotto of Egeria,' till ... the discovery of
the true site of the Porta Capena fixed that of the grotto within the
walls.... It is now known that this nymph&aelig;um ... belonged to the

Egeria's fountain is in the grounds of the Villa Mattei, to the
south-east of the C&aelig;lian, and near the Porta Metronia. "It was buried,
in 1867, by the military engineers, while building their new hospital
near S. Stefano Rotondo" (Prof. Lanciani).

In lines 5-9 Byron is recalling Juvenal's description of the valley of
Egeria, under the mistaken impression that here, and not by "dripping
Capena," was the trysting-place of Numa and the goddess. Juvenal has
accompanied the seer Umbritius, who was leaving Rome for Capua, as far

goods, is being loaded, the friends take a stroll&mdash;

my own speculations, that philosophy will regain that estimation which
it ought to possess. The free and philosophic spirit of our nation has
been the theme of admiration to the world. This was the proud
distinction of Englishmen, and the luminous source of all their glory.
Shall we then forget the manly and dignified sentiments of our
ancestors, to prate in the language of the mother or the nurse about our
good old prejudices? This is not the way to defend the cause of truth.
It was not thus that our fathers maintained it in the brilliant periods
of our history. Prejudice may be trusted to guard the outworks for a
short space of time, while reason slumbers in the citadel; but if the
latter sink into a lethargy, the former will quickly erect a standard
for herself. Philosophy, wisdom, and liberty support each other: he, who
will not reason, is a bigot; he, who cannot, is a fool; and he, who
dares not, is a slave."&mdash;Vol. i. pp. xiv., xv.

The first, second, and third stories of the Flavian amphitheatre or
Colosseum were built upon arches. Between the arches, eighty to each
story or tier, stood three-quarter columns. "Each tier is of a different
order of architecture, the lowest being a plain Roman Doric, or perhaps,
rather, Tuscan, the next Ionic, and the third Corinthian." The fourth
story, which was built by the Emperor Gordianus III., A.D. 244, to take
the place of the original wooden gallery (<i>manianum summum in ligneis</i>),
which was destroyed by lightning, A.D. 217, was a solid wall faced with
Corinthian pilasters, and pierced by forty square windows or openings.
It has been conjectured that the alternate spaces between the pilasters
were decorated with ornamental metal shields. The openings of the outer
arches of the second and third stories were probably decorated with
statues. The reverse of an <i>aureus</i> of the reign of Titus represents the
Colosseum with these statues and a quadriga in the centre. About
one-third of the original structure remains <i>in situ</i>. The prime agent
of destruction was probably the earthquake ("Petrarch's earthquake") of
September, 1349, when the whole of the western side fell towards the
C&aelig;lian, and gave rise to a hill or rather to a chain of hills of loose
blocks of travertine and tufa, which supplied Rome with building
materials for subsequent centuries. As an instance of wholesale
spoliation or appropriation, Professor Lanciani refers to "a document
published by M&uuml;ntz, in the <i>Revue Arch.</i>, September, 1876," which
"certifies that one contractor alone, in the space of only nine months,
in 1452, could carry off 2522 cartloads" of travertine (Smith's <i>Dict.
of Gr. and Rom. Ant.</i>, art. "Amphitheatrum;" <i>Ruins and Excavations of

materials for a <i>hortus siccus</i>, so dear to the visitors of our ruins,
were destroyed by Rosa in 1871, and the ruins scraped and shaven clean,
it being feared by him that the action of roots would accelerate the

<a id="Note_426" name="Note_426">{426}</a> [The whole of this appeal to Nemesis (stanzas
cxxx.-cxxxviii.) must be compared with the "Domestic Poems" of 1816, the
Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> (especially stanzas lxix.-lxxv., and
cxi.-cxviii.), and with the "Invocation" in the first act of <i>Manfred</i>.
It has been argued that Byron inserted these stanzas with the deliberate
purpose of diverting sympathy from his wife to himself. The appeal, no
doubt, is deliberate, and the plea is followed by an indictment, but the
sincerity of the appeal is attested by its inconsistency. Unlike
Orestes, who slew his mother to avenge his father, he will not so deal
with the "moral Clytemnestra of her lord," requiting murder by murder,
but is resolved to leave the balancing of the scale to the omnipotent
Time-spirit who rights every wrong and will redress his injuries. But in
making answer to his accusers he outruns Nemesis, and himself enacts the
part of a "moral" Orestes. It was true that his hopes were "sapped" and
"his name blighted," and it was natural, if not heroic, first to
persuade himself that his suffering exceeded his fault, that he was more
sinned against than sinning, and, so persuaded, to take care that he
should not suffer alone. The general purport of plea and indictment is
plain enough, but the exact interpretation of his phrases, the
appropriation of his dark sayings, belong rather to the biography of the
poet than to a commentary on his poems. (For Lady Byron's comment on the

known in London society." An Italian translation of her novel,
<i>Glenarvon</i>, was at this time in the press at Venice (see letter to
Murray, August 7, 1817), and it is probable that Byron, who declined to
interdict its publication, took his revenge in a petulant stanza, which,
on second thoughts, he decided to omit. (See note by Mr. Richard
Edgcumbe, <i>Notes and Queries</i> eighth series, 1895, viii. 101.)]</p></div>

criticism, has been stoutly maintained; or whether it be a Greek herald,
as that great antiquary positively asserted;<a href="#F511_A">[A]</a> or whether it is to be
thought a Spartan or barbarian shieldbearer, according to the opinion of
his Italian editor; it must assuredly seem <i>a copy</i> of that masterpiece
of Ctesilaus which represented "a wounded man dying, who perfectly
expressed what there remained of life in him." Montfaucon and Maffei
thought it the identical statue; but that statue was of bronze. The
Gladiator was once in the Villa Ludovisi, and was bought by Clement XII.
The right arm is an entire restoration of Michael Angelo.
</p><p>
[There is no doubt that the statue of the "Dying Gladiator" represents a
dying Gaul. It is to be compared with the once-named "Arria and P&aelig;tus"
of the Villa Ludovisi, and with other sculptures in the museums of
Venice, Naples, and Rome, representing "Gauls and Amazons lying fatally
wounded, or still in the attitude of defending life to the last," which
belong to the Pergamene school of the second century B.C. M. Collignon
hazards a suggestion that the "Dying Gaul" is the trumpet-sounder of
Epigonos, in which, says Pliny (<i>Hist. Nat.</i>, xxxiv. 88), the sculptor
surpassed all his previous works ("omnia fere pr&aelig;dicta imitatus
pr&aelig;cessit in tubicine"); while Dr. H. S. Urlichs (see <i>The Elder Pliny's
Chapters on the History of Art</i>, translated by K. Jex-Blake, with
Commentary and Historical Illustrations, by E. Sellers, 1896, p. 74,
note) falls back on Winckelmann's theory that the "statue ... may have
been simply the votive-portrait of the winner in the contest of heralds,
such as that of Archias of Hybla in Delphoi." (See, too, Helbig's <i>Guide
to the Collection of Public Antiquities in Rome</i>, Engl. transl., 1895.

their design as a model in the Catholic church."&mdash;Forsyth's <i>Italy</i>,

[The Pantheon consists of two parts, a porch or <i>pronaos</i> supported by
sixteen Corinthian columns, and behind it, but "obviously disjointed
from it," a rotunda or round temple, 143 feet high, and 142 feet in
diameter. The inscription on the portico (M. AGRIPPA, L. F. Cos.
tertium. Fecit.) affirms that the temple was built by Agrippa (M.
Vipsanius), B.C. 27.
</p><p>
It has long been suspected that with regard to the existing building the
inscription was "historically and artistically misleading;" but it is
only since 1892 that it has been known for certain (from the stamp on
the bricks in various parts of the building) that the rotunda was built
by Hadrian. Difficulties with regard to the relations between the two
parts of the Pantheon remain unsolved, but on the following points
Professor Lanciani claims to speak with certainty:&mdash;
</p><p>
(1) "The present Pantheon, portico included, is not the work of Agrippa,
but of Hadrian, and dates from A.D. 120-124.
</p><p>
(2) "The columns, capital, and entablature of the portico, inscribed
with Agrippa's name, may be original, and may date from 27-25 B.C., but
they were first removed and then put together by Hadrian.
</p><p>
(3) "The original structure of Agrippa was rectangular instead of round,
and faced the south instead of the north."&mdash;<i>Ruins and Excavations,
etc.</i>, by R. Lanciani, 1897, p. 483.]</p></div>

[The traditional scene of the "Caritas Romana" is a cell forming part of
the substructions of the Church of S. Nicola in Carcere, near the Piazza
Montanara. Festus (<i>De Verb. Signif.</i>, lib. xiv., A. J. Valpy, 1826, ii.
594), by way of illustrating Pietas, tells the story in a few words: "It
is said that &AElig;lius dedicated a temple to Pietas on the very spot where a
woman dwelt of yore. Her father was shut up in prison, and she kept him
alive by giving him the breast by stealth, and, as a reward for her
deed, obtained his forgiveness and freedom." In Pliny (Hist. Nat., vii.
36) and in Valerius Maximus (V. 4) it is not a father, but a mother,
whose life is saved by a daughter's piety.]</p></div>

[Hadrian's mole or mausoleum, now the Castle of St. Angelo, is situated
on the banks of the Tiber, on the site of the "Horti Neronis." "It is
composed of a square basement, each side of which measures 247 feet....
A grand circular mole, nearly 1000 feet in circumference, stands on the
square basement," and, originally, "supported in its turn a cone of
earth covered with evergreens, like the mausoleum of Augustus." A spiral
way led to a central chamber in the interior of the mole, which
contained, presumably, the porphyry sarcophagus in which Antoninus Pius
deposited the ashes of Hadrian, and the tomb of the Antonines. Honorius
(A.D. 428) was probably the first to convert the mausoleum into a
fortress. The bronze statue of the Destroying Angel, which is placed on
the summit, dates from 1740, and is the successor to five earlier
statues, of which the first was erected in 1453. The conception and
execution of the Moles Hadriana are entirely Roman, and, except in size
and solidity, it is in no sense a mimic pyramid.&mdash;<i>Ruins and

which stood in the palace of Titus was the work of three sculptors,
natives of Rhodes; and it is now universally admitted that the statue
which was found (January 14, 1516) in the vineyard of Felice de' Freddi,
not far from the ruins of the palace, and is now in the Vatican, is the
statue which Pliny describes. M. Collignon, in his <i>Histoire de la
Sculpture Grecque</i>, gives reasons for assigning the date of the Laocoon
to the first years of the first century B.C. It follows that the work is
a century later than the frieze of the great altar of Pergamos, which
contains the figure of a young giant caught in the toils of Athena's
serpent&mdash;a theme which served as a model for later sculptors of the same
school. In 1817 the Laocoon was in the heyday of its fame, and was
regarded as the supreme achievement of ancient art. Since then it has
been decried and dethroned. M. Collignon protests against this excessive
depreciation, and makes himself the mouthpiece of a second and more
temperate reaction: "On peut ... g&ocirc;uter mediocrement le m&eacute;lodrame, sans
m&eacute;conna&icirc;tre pour cela les r&eacute;elles qualit&eacute;s du groupe. La composition est
d'une structure irr&eacute;prochable, d'une harmonie de lignes qui d&eacute;fie toute
critique. Le torse du Laocoon trahit une science du nu pen commune"
(<i>Hist. de la Sculp. Grecque</i>, 1897, ii. 550, 551).]</p></div>

follows the traditional theory of Montorsoli, the pupil of Michael
Angelo, who restored the left hand and right forearm of the statue. The
god, after his struggle with the python, stands forth proud and
disdainful, the left hand holding a bow, and the right hand falling as
of one who had just shot an arrow. The discovery, in 1860, of a bronze
statuette in the Stroganoff Collection at St. Petersburg, which holds
something like an &aelig;gis and a mantle in the left hand, suggested to
Stephani a second theory, that the Belvidere Apollo was a copy of a
statue of Apollo Bo&euml;dromios, an <i>ex-voto</i> offering on the rout of the
Gauls when they attacked Delphi (B.C. 278). To this theory Furtwaengler
at one time assented, but subsequently came to the conclusion that the
Stroganoff bronze was a forgery. His present contention is that the left
hand held a bow, as Montorsoli imagined, whilst the right grasped "a
branch of laurel, of which the leaves are still visible on the trunk
which the copyist added to the bronze original." The Apollo Belvidere
is, he concludes, a copy of the Apollo Alexicacos of Leochares (fourth
century B.C.), which stood in the Cerameicos at Athens. M. Maxime
Collignon, who utters a word of warning as to the undue depreciation of
the statue by modern critics, adopts Furtwaengler's later theory
(<i>Masterpieces of Ancient Greek Sculpture</i>, by A. Furtwaengler, 1895,
ii. 405, <i>sq.</i>).]</p></div>

<p class="attrib"><a href="#C4_I">Stanza i.</a> lines 1 and 2.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> communication between the ducal palace and the
prisons of Venice is by a gloomy bridge, or covered gallery,
high above the water, and divided by a stone wall into a
passage and a cell. The state dungeons called <i>pozzi</i>, or
wells, were sunk in the thick walls of the palace: and the
prisoner, when taken out to die, was conducted across the
gallery to the other side, and being then led back into
the other compartment, or cell, upon the bridge, was there
strangled. The low portal through which the criminal was
taken into this cell is now walled up; but the passage is still
open, and is still known by the name of the "Bridge of Sighs."
The <i>pozzi</i> are under the flooring of the chamber at the foot
of the bridge. They were formerly twelve; but on the first
arrival of the French, the Venetians hastily blocked or broke
up the deeper of these dungeons. You may still, however
descend by a trap-door, and crawl down through holes, half
choked by rubbish, to the depth of two stories below the first
range. If you are in want of consolation for the extinction of
patrician power, perhaps you may find it there; scarcely a
ray of light glimmers into the narrow gallery which leads to
the cells, and the places of confinement themselves are totally
dark. A small hole in the wall admitted the damp air of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
passages, and served for the introduction of the prisoner's
food. A wooden pallet, raised a foot from the ground, was
the only furniture. The conductors tell you that a light was
not allowed. The cells are about five paces in length, two
and a half in width, and seven feet in height. They are
directly beneath one another, and respiration is somewhat
difficult in the lower holes. Only one prisoner was found
when the republicans descended into these hideous recesses,
and he is said to have been confined sixteen years. But the
inmates of the dungeons beneath had left traces of their
repentance, or of their despair, which are still visible, and
may, perhaps, owe something to recent ingenuity. Some of
the detained appear to have offended against, and others to
have belonged to, the sacred body, not only from their signatures,
but from the churches and belfries which they have
scratched upon the walls. The reader may not object to see
a specimen of the records prompted by so terrific a solitude.

<p>["I cannot forbear mentioning a custom in Venice, which
they tell me is particular to the common people of this
country, of singing stanzas out of Tasso. They are set to a
pretty solemn tune, and when one begins in any part of the
poet, it is odds but he will be answered by somebody else
that overhears him; so that sometimes you have ten or a
dozen in the neighbourhood of one another, taking verse after
verse, and running on with the poem as far as their memories
will carry them."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Addison</span>, A.D. 1700.]</p>

<p>The well-known song of the gondoliers, of alternate stanzas
from Tasso's <i>Jerusalem</i>, has died with the independence of
Venice. Editions of the poem, with the original in one
column, and the Venetian variations on the other, as sung by
the boatmen, were once common, and are still to be found.

<p>Some of the elder gondoliers will, however, take up and continue
a stanza of their once familiar bard.</p>

<p>On the 7th of last January, the author of <i>Childe Harold</i>,
and another Englishman, the writer of this notice, rowed to
the Lido with two singers, one of whom was a carpenter, and
the other a gondolier. The former placed himself at the
prow, the latter at the stern of the boat. A little after leaving
the quay of the Piazzetta, they began to sing, and continued
their exercise until we arrived at the island. They gave us,
amongst other essays, the death of Clorinda, and the palace
of Armida; and did not sing the Venetian but the Tuscan
verses. The carpenter, however, who was the cleverer of the
two, and was frequently obliged to prompt his companion,
told us that he could <i>translate</i> the original. He added, that
he could sing almost three hundred stanzas, but had not
spirits (<i>morbin</i> was the word he used) to learn any more, or
to sing what he already knew: a man must have idle time on
his hands to acquire, or to repeat, and, said the poor fellow,
"look at my clothes and at me; I am starving." This speech
was more affecting than his performance, which habit alone
can make attractive. The recitative was shrill, screaming,
and monotonous; and the gondolier behind assisted his voice
by holding his hand to one side of his mouth. The carpenter
used a quiet action, which he evidently endeavoured to
restrain; but was too much interested in his subject altogether
to repress. From these men we learnt that singing
is not confined to the gondoliers, and that, although the
chant is seldom, if ever, voluntary, there are still several
amongst the lower classes who are acquainted with a few stanzas.</p>

<p>It does not appear that it is usual for the performers to row
and sing at the same time. Although the verses of the
<i>Jerusalem</i> are no longer casually heard, there is yet much
music upon the Venetian canals; and upon holydays, those
strangers who are not near or informed enough to distinguish
the words, may fancy that many of the gondolas still resound
with the strains of Tasso. The writer of some remarks which
appeared in the <i>Curiosities of Literature</i> must excuse his
being twice quoted; for, with the exception of some phrases
a little too ambitious and extravagant, he has furnished a
very exact, as well as agreeable description:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In Venice the gondoliers know by heart long passages
from Ariosto and Tasso, and often chant them with a peculiar
melody. But this talent seems at present on the decline:&mdash;at
least, after taking some pains, I could find no more than
two persons who delivered to me in this way a passage from
Tasso. I must add, that the late Mr. Berry once chanted to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
me a passage in Tasso in the manner, as he assured me, of
the gondoliers.</p>

<p>"There are always two concerned, who alternately sing the
strophes. We know the melody eventually by Rousseau, to
whose songs it is printed; it has properly no melodious
movement, and is a sort of medium between the canto fermo
and the canto figurato; it approaches to the former by
recitativical declamation, and to the latter by passages and
course, by which one syllable is detained and embellished.</p>

<p>"I entered a gondola by moonlight; one singer placed
himself forwards and the other aft, and thus proceeded to
St. Georgio. One began the song: when he had ended his
strophe, the other took up the lay, and so continued the song
alternately. Throughout the whole of it, the same notes
invariably returned; but, according to the subject-matter of
the strophe, they laid a greater or a smaller stress, sometimes
on one, and sometimes on another note, and indeed changed
the enunciation of the whole strophe as the object of the
poem altered.</p>

<p>"On the whole, however, the sounds were hoarse and
screaming: they seemed, in the manner of all rude uncivilised
men, to make the excellency of their singing in the force of
their voice. One seemed desirous of conquering the other
by the strength of his lungs; and so far from receiving
delight from this scene (shut up as I was in the box of the
gondola), I found myself in a very unpleasant situation.</p>

<p>"My companion, to whom I communicated this circumstance,
being very desirous to keep up the credit of his
countrymen, assured me that the singing was very delightful
when heard at a distance. Accordingly we got out upon the
shore, leaving one of the singers in the gondola, while the
other went to the distance of some hundred paces. They
now began to sing against one another, and I kept walking
up and down between them both, so as always to leave him
who was to begin his part. I frequently stood still and
hearkened to the one and to the other.</p>

<p>"Here the scene was properly introduced. The strong
declamatory, and, as it were, shrieking sound, met the ear
from far, and called forth the attention; the quickly succeeding
transitions, which necessarily required to be sung in a
lower tone, seemed like plaintive strains succeeding the
vociferations of emotion or of pain. The other, who listened
attentively, immediately began where the former left off,
answering him in milder or more vehement notes, according
as the purport of the strophe required. The sleepy canals,
the lofty buildings, the splendour of the moon, the deep
shadows of the few gondolas that moved like spirits hither
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
and thither, increased the striking peculiarity of the scene;
and, amidst all these circumstances, it was easy to confess
the character of this wonderful harmony.</p>

<p>"It suits perfectly well with an idle, solitary mariner, lying
at length in his vessel at rest on one of these canals, waiting
for his company, or for a fare, the tiresomeness of which
situation is somewhat alleviated by the songs and poetical
stories he has in memory. He often raises his voice as loud
as he can, which extends itself to a vast distance over the
tranquil mirror; and as all is still around, he is, as it were,
in a solitude in the midst of a large and populous town.
Here is no rattling of carriages, no noise of foot passengers;
a silent gondola glides now and then by him, of which the
splashings of the oars are scarcely to be heard.</p>

<p>"At a distance he hears another, perhaps utterly unknown
to him. Melody and verse immediately attach the two
strangers; he becomes the responsive echo to the former,
and exerts himself to be heard as he had heard the other.
By a tacit convention they alternate verse for verse; though
the song should last the whole night through, they entertain
themselves without fatigue: the hearers who are passing
between the two take part in the amusement.</p>

<p>"This vocal performance sounds best at a great distance,
and is then inexpressibly charming, as it only fulfills its design
in the sentiment of remoteness. It is plaintive, but not dismal
in its sound, and at times it is scarcely possible to refrain
from tears. My companion, who otherwise was not a very
delicately organised person, said quite unexpectedly: E
singolare come quel canto intenerisce, e molto pi&ugrave; quando lo
cantano meglio.</p>

<p>"I was told that the women of Libo, the long row of islands
that divides the Adriatic from the Lagoons,<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> particularly the
women of the extreme districts of Malamocca and Palestrina,
sing in like manner the works of Tasso to these and similar tunes.</p>

<p>"They have the custom, when their husbands are fishing
out at sea, to sit along the shore in the evenings and vociferate
these songs, and continue to do so with great violence, till
each of them can distinguish the responses of her own husband
at a distance."<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span></p>
<p>The love of music and of poetry distinguishes all classes
of Venetians, even amongst the tuneful sons of Italy. The
city itself can occasionally furnish respectable audiences for
two and even three opera-houses at a time; and there are
few events in private life that do not call forth a printed and
circulated sonnet. Does a physician or a lawyer take his
degree, or a clergyman preach his maiden sermon, has a
surgeon performed an operation, would a harlequin announce
his departure or his benefit, are you to be congratulated on
a marriage, or a birth, or a lawsuit, the Muses are invoked
to furnish the same number of syllables, and the individual
triumphs blaze abroad in virgin white or party-coloured
placards on half the corners of the capital. The last curtsy
of a favourite "prima donna" brings down a shower of these
poetical tributes from those upper regions, from which, in our
theatres, nothing but cupids and snowstorms are accustomed
to descend. There is a poetry in the very life of a Venetian,
which, in its common course, is varied with those surprises
and changes so recommendable in fiction, but so different
from the sober monotony of northern existence; amusements
are raised into duties, duties are softened into amusements,
and every object being considered as equally making a part
of the business of life, is announced and performed with the
same earnest indifference and gay assiduity. The Venetian
gazette constantly closes its columns with the following triple
advertisement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center" >
                              <i>Charade.</i><br />

     Exposition of the most Holy Sacrament in the church of St.&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<br />
                              <i>Theatres</i>.<br />

                     St. Moses, opera.<br />
                     St. Benedict, a comedy of characters.<br />
                     St. Luke, repose.
</p>

<p>When it is recollected what the Catholics believe their
consecrated wafer to be, we may perhaps think it worthy of a
more respectable niche than between poetry and the playhouse.</p>

level with the other foot. The horses also are returned
[A.D. 1815] to the ill-chosen spot whence they set out, and
are, as before, half hidden under the porch window of St.
Mark's Church. Their history, after a desperate struggle,
has been satisfactorily explored. The decisions and doubts
of Erizzo and Zanetti, and lastly, of the Count Leopold
Cicognara, would have given them a Roman extraction, and
a pedigree not more ancient than the reign of Nero. But
M. de Schlegel stepped in to teach the Venetians the value
of their own treasures; and a Greek vindicated, at last and for
ever, the pretension of his countrymen to this noble production<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>.</p>

<p>M. Mustoxidi has not been left without a reply;
but, as yet, he has received no answer. It should seem that
the horses are irrevocably Chian, and were transferred to
Constantinople by Theodosius. Lapidary writing is a favourite
play of the Italians, and has conferred reputation on more
than one of their literary characters. One of the best
specimens of Bodoni's typography is a respectable volume of
inscriptions, all written by his friend Pacciaudi. Several
were prepared for the recovered horses. It is to be hoped
the best was not selected, when the following words were
ranged in gold letters above the cathedral porch:&mdash;</p>

<p style="font-size:90%;">QUATUOR &#183; EQUORUM &#183; SIGNA &#183;

<p>Nothing shall be said of the Latin, but it may be permitted
to observe, that the injustice of the Venetians in transporting
the horses from Constantinople [A.D. 1204] was at least equal
to that of the French in carrying them to Paris [A.D. 1797],
and that it would have been more prudent to have avoided
all allusions to either robbery. An apostolic prince should,
perhaps, have objected to affixing over the principal entrance
of a metropolitan church an inscription having a reference to
any other triumphs than those of religion. Nothing less than
the pacification of the world can excuse such a solecism.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>After many vain efforts on the part of the Italians entirely
to throw off the yoke of Frederic Barbarossa, and as fruitless
attempts of the Emperor to make himself absolute master
throughout the whole of his Cisalpine dominions, the bloody
struggles of four-and-twenty years were happily brought to a
close in the city of Venice. The articles of a treaty had been
previously agreed upon between Pope Alexander III. and
Barbarossa; and the former having received a safe-conduct,
had already arrived at Venice from Ferrara, in company
with the ambassadors of the King of Sicily and the consuls
of the Lombard League. There still remained, however,
many points to adjust, and for several days the peace was
believed to be impracticable. At this juncture, it was suddenly
reported that the Emperor had arrived at Chioza, a
town fifteen miles from the capital. The Venetians rose
tumultuously, and insisted upon immediately conducting him
to the city. The Lombards took the alarm, and departed
towards Treviso. The Pope himself was apprehensive of
some disaster if Frederic should suddenly advance upon him,
but was reassured by the prudence and address of Sebastian
Ziani, the Doge. Several embassies passed between Chioza
and the capital, until, at last, the Emperor, relaxing somewhat
of his pretensions, "laid aside his leonine ferocity, and
put on the mildness of the lamb."<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>On Saturday, the 23rd of July, in the year 1177, six
Venetian galleys transferred Frederic, in great pomp, from
Chioza to the island of Lido, a mile from Venice. Early the
next morning, the Pope, accompanied by the Sicilian ambassadors,
and by the envoys of Lombardy, whom he had
recalled from the main land, together with a great concourse
of people, repaired from the patriarchal palace to St. Mark's
Church, and solemnly absolved the Emperor and his partisans
from the excommunication pronounced against him.
The Chancellor of the Empire, on the part of his master,
renounced the anti-popes and their schismatic adherents.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately the Doge, with a great suite both of the clergy
and laity, got on board the galleys, and waiting on Frederic,
rowed him in mighty state from the Lido to the capital.
The Emperor descended from the galley at the quay of the
Piazzetta. The Doge, the patriarch, his bishops and clergy,
and the people of Venice with their crosses and their
standards, marched in solemn procession before him to the
church of St. Mark. Alexander was seated before the vestibule
of the basilica, attended by his bishops and cardinals,
by the patriarch of Aquileja, by the archbishops and bishops
of Lombardy, all of them in state, and clothed in their church
robes. Frederic approached&mdash;"moved by the Holy Spirit,
venerating the Almighty in the person of Alexander, laying
aside his imperial dignity, and throwing off his mantle, he
prostrated himself at full length at the feet of the Pope.
Alexander, with tears in his eyes, raised him benignantly
from the ground, kissed him, blessed him; and immediately
the Germans of the train sang with a loud voice, 'We praise
thee, O Lord.' The Emperor then taking the Pope by the
right hand, led him to the church, and having received his
benediction, returned to the ducal palace."<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> The ceremony
of humiliation was repeated the next day. The Pope himself,
at the request of Frederic, said mass at St. Mark's. The
Emperor again laid aside his imperial mantle, and taking a
wand in his hand, officiated as <i>verger</i>, driving the laity from
the choir, and preceding the pontiff to the altar. Alexander,
after reciting the gospel, preached to the people. The
Emperor put himself close to the pulpit in the attitude of
listening; and the pontiff, touched by this mark of his attention
(for he knew that Frederic did not understand a word he said),
commanded the patriarch of Aquileja to translate the
Latin discourse into the German tongue. The creed was
then chanted. Frederic made his oblation, and kissed the
Pope's feet, and, mass being over, led him by the hand to his
white horse. He held the stirrup, and would have led the
horse's rein to the water side, had not the Pope accepted of
the inclination for the performance, and affectionately dismissed
him with his benediction. Such is the substance
of the account left by the archbishop of Salerno, who was
present at the ceremony, and whose story is confirmed by
every subsequent narration. It would be not worth so
minute a record, were it not the triumph of liberty as well as
of superstition. The states of Lombardy owed to it the confirmation
of their privileges; and Alexander had reason to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
thank the Almighty, who had enabled an infirm, unarmed old
man to subdue a terrible and potent sovereign.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>The reader will recollect the exclamation of the Highlander,
"<i>Oh, for one hour of Dundee</i>!" Henry Dandolo,
when elected Doge, in 1192, was eighty-five years of age.
When he commanded the Venetians at the taking of Constantinople,
he was consequently ninety-seven years old. At
this age he annexed the fourth and a half of the whole empire
of Romania,<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> for so the Roman empire was then called, to
the title and to the territories of the Venetian Doge. The
three-eighths of this empire were preserved in the diplomas
until the Dukedom of Giovanni Dolfino, who made use of the
above designation in the year 1357.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p>


<p>Dandolo led the attack on Constantinople in person. Two
ships, the Paradise and the Pilgrim, were tied together, and
a drawbridge or ladder let down from their higher yards to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
the walls. The Doge was one of the first to rush into the
city. Then was completed, said the Venetians, the prophecy
of the Erythr&aelig;an sibyl:&mdash;"A gathering together of the
powerful shall be made amidst the waves of the Adriatic,
under a blind leader; they shall beset the goat&mdash;they shall
profane Byzantium&mdash;they shall blacken her buildings&mdash;her
spoils shall be dispersed; a new goat shall bleat until they
have measured out and run over fifty-four feet nine inches
and a half."<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> Dandolo died on the first day of June, 1205,
having reigned thirteen years six months and five days, and
was buried in the church of St. Sophia, at Constantinople.
Strangely enough it must sound, that the name of the rebel
apothecary who received the Doge's sword, and annihilated
the ancient government, in 1796-7, was Dandolo.</p>

<p>After the loss of the battle of Pola, and the taking of
Chioza on the 16th of August, 1379, by the united armament
of the Genoese and Francesco da Carrara, Signor of Padua,
the Venetians were reduced to the utmost despair. An
embassy was sent to the conquerors with a blank sheet of
paper, praying them to prescribe what terms they pleased,
and leave to Venice only her independence. The Prince of
Padua was inclined to listen to these proposals; but the
Genoese, who, after the victory at Pola, had shouted, "To
Venice! to Venice! and long live St. George!" determined
to annihilate their rival; and Peter Doria, their commander-in-chief,
returned this answer to the suppliants: "On God's
faith, gentlemen of Venice, ye shall have no peace from the
Signer of Padua, nor from our commune of Genoa, until we
have first put a rein upon those unbridled horses of yours, that
are upon the porch of your evangelist St. Mark. When we
have bridled them we shall keep you quiet. And this is the
pleasure of us and of our commune. As for these, my brothers
of Genoa, that you have brought with you to give up to us, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
will not have them: take them back; for in a few days
hence, I shall come and let them out of prison myself, both
these and all the others" [p. 727, E. <i>vide infra</i>]. In fact, the
Genoese did advance as far as Malamocco, within five miles
of the capital; but their own danger, and the pride of their
enemies, gave courage to the Venetians, who made prodigious
efforts, and many individual sacrifices, all of them carefully
recorded by their historians. Vettor Pisani was put at the
head of thirty-four galleys. The Genoese broke up from
Malamocco, and retired to Chioza in October; but they
again threatened Venice, which was reduced to extremities.
At this time, the 1st of January, 1380, arrived Carlo Zeno,
who had been cruising on the Genoese coast with fourteen
galleys. The Venetians were now strong enough to besiege
the Genoese. Doria was killed on the 22nd of January, by a
stone bullet, one hundred and ninety-five pounds' weight, discharged
from a bombard called the Trevisan. Chioza was
then closely invested; five thousand auxiliaries, among whom
were some English condottieri, commanded by one Captain
Ceccho, joined the Venetians. The Genoese, in their turn,
prayed for conditions, but none were granted, until, at last,
they surrendered at discretion; and, on the 24th of June,
1380, the Doge Contarini made his triumphal entry into
Chioza. Four thousand prisoners, nineteen galleys, many
smaller vessels and barks, with all the ammunition and arms,
and outfit of the expedition, fell into the hands of the conquerors,
who, had it not been for the inexorable answer of
Doria, would have gladly reduced their dominion to the city
of Venice. An account of these transactions is found in a
work called <i>The War of Chioza</i>,<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> written by Daniel Chinazzo,

<p>The population of Venice, at the end of the seventeenth
century, amounted to nearly two hundred thousand souls. At
the last census, taken two years ago [1816], it was no more than
about one hundred and three thousand; and it diminishes
daily. The commerce and the official employments, which
were to be the unexhausted source of Venetian grandeur,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
have both expired.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> Most of the patrician mansions are
deserted, and would gradually disappear, had not the Government,
alarmed by the demolition of seventy-two during the
last two years, expressly forbidden this sad resource of poverty.
Many remnants of the Venetian nobility are now scattered,
and confounded with the wealthier Jews upon the banks of
the Brenta, whose Palladian palaces have sunk, or are sinking,
in the general decay. Of the "gentiluomo Veneto," the
name is still known, and that is all. He is but the shadow
of his former self, but he is polite and kind. It surely may
be pardoned to him if he is querulous. Whatever may have
been the vices of the republic, and although the natural term
of its existence may be thought by foreigners to have arrived
in the due course of mortality, only one sentiment can be
expected from the Venetians themselves. At no time were
the subjects of the republic so unanimous in their resolution
to rally round the standard of St. Mark, as when it was for
the last time unfurled; and the cowardice and the treachery
of the few patricians who recommended the fatal neutrality,
were confined to the persons of the traitors themselves. The
present race cannot be thought to regret the loss of their
aristocratical forms, and too despotic government; they think
only on their vanished independence. They pine away at
the remembrance, and on this subject suspend for a moment
their gay good humour. Venice may be said, in the words
of the Scripture, "to die daily;" and so general and so
apparent is the decline, as to become painful to a stranger,
not reconciled to the sight of a whole nation expiring, as it
were, before his eyes. So artificial a creation, having lost
that principle which called it into life and supported its
existence, must fall to pieces at once, and sink more rapidly
than it rose. The abhorrence of slavery, which drove the
Venetians to the sea, has, since their disaster, forced them
to the land, where they may be at least overlooked amongst
the crowd of dependents, and not present the humiliating
spectacle of a whole nation loaded with recent chains. Their
liveliness, their affability, and that happy indifference which
constitution alone can give (for philosophy aspires to it in
vain), have not sunk under circumstances; but many peculiarities
of costume and manner have by degrees been lost;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
and the nobles, with a pride common to all Italians who have
been masters, have not been persuaded to parade their insignificance.
That splendour which was a proof and a portion
of their power, they would not degrade into the trappings of
their subjection. They retired from the space which they
had occupied in the eyes of their fellow citizens; their continuance
in which would have been a symptom of acquiescence,
and an insult to those who suffered by the common misfortune.
Those who remained in the degraded capital, might be said
rather to haunt the scenes of their departed power, than to
live in them. The reflection, "who and what enthrals," will
hardly bear a comment from one who is, nationally, the
friend and the ally of the conqueror. It may, however, be
allowed to say thus much, that to those who wish to recover
their independence, any masters must be an object of detestation;
and it may be safely foretold that this unprofitable
aversion will not have been corrected before Venice shall
have sunk into the slime of her choked canals.</p>

<p>Thanks to the critical acumen of a Scotchman, we now
know as little of Laura as ever.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> The discoveries of the
Abb&eacute; de Sade, his triumphs, his sneers, can no longer instruct
or amuse. We must not, however, think that these memoirs<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
are as much a romance as Belisarius or the Incas, although
we are told so by Dr. Beattie, a great name, but a little
authority.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> His "labour" has not been in vain, notwithstanding
his "love" has, like most other passions, made
him ridiculous.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> The hypothesis which overpowered the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
struggling Italians, and carried along less interested critics
in its current, is run out. We have another proof that we
can never be sure that the paradox, the most singular, and
therefore having the most agreeable and authentic air, will
not give place to the re-established ancient prejudice.</p>

<p>It seems, then, first, that Laura was born, lived, died, and
was buried, not in Avignon, but in the country. The fountains
of the Sorga, the thickets of Cabrieres, may resume their
pretensions, and the exploded <i>de la Bastie</i> again be heard
with complacency. The hypothesis of the Abb&eacute; had no
stronger props than the parchment sonnet and medal found
on the skeleton of the wife of Hugo de Sade, and the manuscript
note to the <i>Virgil</i> of Petrarch, now in the Ambrosian
library. If these proofs were both incontestable, the poetry
was written, the medal composed, cast, and deposited within
the space of twelve hours: and these deliberate duties were
performed round the carcass of one who died of the plague,
and was hurried to the grave on the day of her death. These
documents, therefore, are too decisive: they prove not the
fact, but the forgery. Either the sonnet or the Virgilian note
must be a falsification. The Abb&eacute; cites both as incontestably
true; the consequent deduction is inevitable&mdash;they are both
evidently false.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>


<p>Secondly, Laura was never married, and was a haughty
virgin rather than that <i>tender and prudent</i> wife who honoured
Avignon, by making that town the theatre of an honest
French passion, and played off for one and twenty years her
<i>little machinery</i> of alternate favours and refusals<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> upon the
first poet of the age. It was, indeed, rather too unfair that a
female should be made responsible for eleven children upon
the faith of a misinterpreted abbreviation, and the decision
of a librarian.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> It is, however, satisfactory to think that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
love of Petrarch was not platonic. The happiness which he
prayed to possess but once and for a moment was surely not
of the mind,<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> and something so very real as a marriage
project, with one who has been idly called a shadowy nymph,
may be, perhaps, detected in at least six places of his own
sonnets. The love of Petrarch was neither platonic nor
poetical; and if in one passage of his works he calls it
"amore veementeissimo ma unico ed onesto," he confesses,
in a letter to a friend, that it was guilty and perverse, that it
absorbed him quite, and mastered his heart.</p>

<p>In this case, however, he was perhaps alarmed for the
culpability of his wishes; for the Abb&eacute; de Sade himself, who
certainly would not have been scrupulously delicate if he
could have proved his descent from Petrarch as well as Laura,
is forced into a stout defence of his virtuous grandmother.
As far as relates to the poet, we have no security for the
innocence, except perhaps in the constancy of his pursuit.
He assures us in his epistle to posterity, that, when arrived
at his fortieth year, he not only had in horror, but had lost
all recollection and image of any "irregularity." But the
birth of his natural daughter cannot be assigned earlier than
his thirty-ninth year; and either the memory or the morality
of the poet must have failed him, when he forgot or was
guilty of this <i>slip</i>.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> The weakest argument for the purity of
this love has been drawn from the permanence of its effects,
which survived the object of his passion. The reflection of
M. de la Bastie, that virtue alone is capable of making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
impressions which death cannot efface, is one of those which
everybody applauds, and everybody finds not to be true, the
moment he examines his own breast or the records of human
feeling.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Such apophthegms can do nothing for Petrarch or
for the cause of morality, except with the very weak and the
very young. He that has made even a little progress beyond
ignorance and pupilage cannot be edified with anything but
truth. What is called vindicating the honour of an individual
or a nation, is the most futile, tedious, and uninstructive of
all writing; although it will always meet with more applause
than that sober criticism, which is attributed to the malicious
desire of reducing a great man to the common standard of
humanity. It is, after all, not unlikely that our historian was
right in retaining his favourite hypothetic salvo, which secures
the author, although it scarcely saves the honour of the still
unknown mistress of Petrarch.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>Petrarch retired to Arqu&agrave; immediately on his return from
the unsuccessful attempt to visit Urban V. at Rome, in the
year 1370, and with the exception of his celebrated visit to
Venice in company with Francesco Novello da Carrara, he
appears to have passed the four last years of his life between
that charming solitude and Padua. For four months previous
to his death he was in a state of continual languor, and in
the morning of July the 19th, in the year 1374, was found
dead in his library chair with his head resting upon a book.
The chair is still shown amongst the precious relics of Arqu&agrave;,
which, from the uninterrupted veneration that has been
attached to everything relative to this great man from the
moment of his death to the present hour, have, it may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
hoped, a better chance of authenticity than the Shaksperian
memorials of Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<p>Arqu&agrave; (for the last syllable is accented in pronunciation,
although the analogy of the English language has been
observed in the verse) is twelve miles from Padua, and about
three miles on the right of the high road to Rovigo, in the
bosom of the Euganean hills. After a walk of twenty minutes
across a flat well-wooded meadow, you come to a little blue
lake, clear but fathomless, and to the foot of a succession of
acclivities and hills, clothed with vineyards and orchards,
rich with fir and pomegranate trees, and every sunny fruit
shrub. From the banks of the lake the road winds into the
hills, and the church of Arqu&agrave; is soon seen between a cleft
where two ridges slope towards each other, and nearly enclose
the village. The houses are scattered at intervals on the
steep sides of these summits; and that of the poet is on the
edge of a little knoll overlooking two descents, and commanding
a view, not only of the glowing gardens in the dales
immediately beneath, but of the wide plains, above whose low
woods of mulberry and willow, thickened into a dark mass by
festoons of vines, tall, single cypresses, and the spires of
towns, are seen in the distance, which stretches to the mouths
of the Po and the shores of the Adriatic. The climate of
these volcanic hills is warmer, and the vintage begins a week
sooner than in the plains of Padua. Petrarch is laid, for he
cannot be said to be buried, in a sarcophagus of red marble,
raised on four pilasters on an elevated base, and preserved
from an association with meaner tombs. It stands conspicuously
alone, but will be soon overshadowed by four
lately planted laurels. Petrarch's Fountain, for here everything
is Petrarch's, springs and expands itself beneath an
artificial arch, a little below the church, and abounds plentifully,
in the driest season, with that soft water which was the
ancient wealth of the Euganean hills. It would be more
attractive, were it not, in some seasons, beset with hornets
and wasps. No other coincidence could assimilate the tombs
of Petrarch and Archilochus. The revolutions of centuries
have spared these sequestered valleys, and the only violence
which has been offered to the ashes of Petrarch was prompted,
not by hate, but veneration. An attempt was made to rob
the sarcophagus of its treasure, and one of the arms was
stolen by a Florentine through a rent which is still visible.
The injury is not forgotten, but has served to identify the
poet with the country where he was born, but where he would
not live. A peasant boy of Arqu&agrave; being asked who Petrarch
was, replied, "that the people of the parsonage knew all
about him, but that he only knew that he was a Florentine."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Forsyth<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> was not quite correct in saying that Petrarch
never returned to Tuscany after he had once quitted it when
a boy. It appears he did pass through Florence on his way
from Parma to Rome, and on his return in the year 1350,
and remained there long enough to form some acquaintance
with its most distinguished inhabitants. A Florentine gentleman,
ashamed of the aversion of the poet for his native
country, was eager to point out this trivial error in our accomplished
traveller, whom he knew and respected for an extraordinary
capacity, extensive erudition, and refined taste,
joined to that engaging simplicity of manners which has been
so frequently recognised as the surest, though it is certainly
not an indispensable, trait of superior genius.</p>

<p>Every footstep of Laura's lover has been anxiously traced
and recorded. The house in which he lodged is shown in
Venice. The inhabitants of Arezzo, in order to decide the
ancient controversy between their city and the neighbouring
Ancisa, where Petrarch was carried when seven months old,
and remained until his seventh year, have designated by a
long inscription the spot where their great fellow citizen was
born. A tablet has been raised to him at Parma, in the
chapel of St. Agatha, at the cathedral, because he was arch-deacon
of that society, and was only snatched from his
intended sepulture in their church by a <i>foreign</i> death. Another
tablet, with a bust, has been erected to him at Pavia, on
account of his having passed the autumn of 1368 in that city,
with his son-in-law Brossano. The political condition which
has for ages precluded the Italians from the criticism of the
living, has concentrated their attention to the illustration of
the dead.</p>

<p>The biographer Serassi,<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> out of tenderness to the reputation
either of the Italian or the French poet, is eager to
observe that the satirist recanted or explained away this
censure, and subsequently allowed the author of the <i>Jerusalem</i>
to be "a genius sublime, vast, and happily born for the
higher flights of poetry." To this we will add, that the recantation
is far from satisfactory, when we examine the whole
anecdote as reported by Olivet.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> The sentence pronounced
against him by Bouhours<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> is recorded only to the confusion of
the critic, whose <i>palinodia</i> the Italian makes no effort to discover,
and would not, perhaps, accept. As to the opposition
which the <i>Jerusalem</i> encountered from the Cruscan academy,
who degraded Tasso from all competition with Ariosto, below
Bojardo and Pulci, the disgrace of such opposition must also
in some measure be laid to the charge of Alfonso, and the
court of Ferrara. For Leonard Salviati, the principal and
nearly the sole origin of this attack, was, there can be no
doubt,<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> influenced by a hope to acquire the favour of the
House of Este: an object which he thought attainable by
exalting the reputation of a native poet at the expense of a
rival, then a <i>prisoner of state</i>. The hopes and efforts of
Salviati must serve to show the contemporary opinion as to

the antagonist of Tasso was not disappointed in the reception
given to his criticism; he was called to the court of Ferrara,
where, having endeavoured to heighten his claims to favour,
by panegyrics on the family of his sovereign,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> he was in turn
abandoned, and expired in neglected poverty. The opposition
of the Cruscans was brought to a close in six years after the
commencement of the controversy; and if the Academy owed
its first renown to having almost opened with such a paradox,<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>
it is probable that, on the other hand, the care of his reputation
alleviated rather than aggravated the imprisonment of
the injured poet. The defence of his father and of himself,
for both were involved in the censure of Salviati, found
employment for many of his solitary hours, and the captive
could have been but little embarrassed to reply to accusations,
where, among other delinquencies, he was charged
with invidiously omitting, in his comparison between France
and Italy, to make any mention of the cupola of St. Maria
del Fiore at Florence.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The late biographer of Ariosto seems

of Tasso's self-estimation<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> related in Serassi's life
of the poet. But Tiraboschi had before laid that rivalry at
rest,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> by showing that between Ariosto and Tasso it is not a
question of comparison, but of preference.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>

<p>The Curtian lake and the Ruminal fig-tree in the Forum,
having been touched by lightning, were held sacred, and the
memory of the accident was preserved by a <i>pateal</i>, or altar
resembling the mouth of a well, with a little chapel covering
the cavity supposed to be made by the thunder-bolt. Bodies
scathed and persons struck dead were thought to be incorruptible;<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>

<p>Those killed by lightning were wrapped in a white garment,

to the worshippers of Jupiter: the Lombards believed

confesses that, by a diabolical skill in interpreting thunder,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>

however, something equivocal in this sign, which the ancient

as the fears are likely to last longer than the consolations of
superstition, it is not strange that the Romans of the age of
Leo X. should have been so much terrified at some misinterpreted
storms as to require the exhortations of a scholar, who
arrayed all the learning on thunder and lightning to prove
the omen favourable; beginning with the flash which struck
the walls of Velitr&aelig;;, and including that which played upon a

<p>The view of the Venus of Medicis instantly suggests the

The same conclusion may be deduced from another hint in
the same episode of Musidora; for Thomson's notion of the

<p>The reader will recollect the anecdote told in the <i>Life of Dr.

of that disputed statue should not be entirely decided, at

the vestibule of the Basilica of St. Paul without the walls, at
Rome, where the whole group of the fable of Marsyas is seen

in tolerable preservation; and the Scythian slave whetting
the knife, is represented exactly in the same position as this
celebrated masterpiece. The slave is not naked; but it is
easier to get rid of this difficulty than to suppose the knife in
the hand of the Florentine statue an instrument for shaving,
which it must be, if, as Lanzi supposes, the man is no other
than the barber of Julius C&aelig;sar. Winckelmann, illustrating
a bas-relief of the same subject, follows the opinion of Leonard
Agostini, and his authority might have been thought conclusive,

<p>This name will recall the memory, not only of those whose
tombs have raised the Santa Croce into the centre of pilgrimage&mdash;the
Mecca of Italy&mdash;but of her whose eloquence
was poured over the illustrious ashes, and whose voice is now
as mute as those she sung. <span class="smcap">Corinna</span> is no more; and with
her should expire the fear, the flattery, and the envy, which
threw too dazzling or too dark a cloud round the march of
genius, and forbad the steady gaze of disinterested criticism.
We have her picture embellished or distorted, as friendship
or detraction has held the pencil: the impartial portrait was
hardly to be expected from a contemporary. The immediate
voice of her survivors will, it is probable, be far from affording
a just estimate of her singular capacity. The gallantry,
the love of wonder, and the hope of associated fame, which
blunted the edge of censure, must cease to exist.&mdash;The dead
have no sex; they can surprise by no new miracles; they
can confer no privilege: Corinna has ceased to be a woman&mdash;she
is only an author; and it may be foreseen that many
will repay themselves for former complaisance, by a severity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
to which the extravagance of previous praises may perhaps
give the colour of truth. The latest posterity&mdash;for to the
latest posterity they will assuredly descend&mdash;will have to
pronounce upon her various productions; and the longer the
vista through which they are seen, the more accurately
minute will be the object, the more certain the justice, of the
decision. She will enter into that existence in which the
great writers of all ages and nations are, as it were, associated
in a world of their own, and, from that superior sphere, shed
their eternal influence for the control and consolation of
mankind. But the individual will gradually disappear as
the author is more distinctly seen; some one, therefore, of
all those whom the charms of involuntary wit, and of easy
hospitality, attracted within the friendly circles of Coppet,
should rescue from oblivion those virtues which, although
they are said to love the shade, are, in fact, more frequently
chilled than excited by the domestic cares of private life.
Some one should be found to portray the unaffected graces
with which she adorned those dearer relationships, the performance
of whose duties is rather discovered amongst the
interior secrets, than seen in the outward management, of
family intercourse; and which, indeed, it requires the delicacy
of genuine affection to qualify for the eye of an indifferent
spectator. Some one should be found, not to celebrate, but
to describe, the amiable mistress of an open mansion, the
centre of a society, ever varied, and always pleased, the
creator of which, divested of the ambition and the arts of
public rivalry, shone forth only to give fresh animation to
those around her. The mother tenderly affectionate and
tenderly beloved, the friend unboundedly generous, but still
esteemed, the charitable patroness of all distress, cannot be
forgotten by those whom she cherished, and protected, and
fed. Her loss will be mourned the most where she was
known the best; and, to the sorrows of very many friends,
and more dependants, may be offered the disinterested regret
of a stranger, who, amidst the sublimer scenes of the Leman
lake, received his chief satisfaction from contemplating the
engaging qualities of the incomparable Corinna.</p>

<p>Alfieri is the great name of this age. The Italians, without
waiting for the hundred years, consider him as "a poet

he is the bard of freedom; and because, as such, his tragedies
can receive no countenance from any of their sovereigns.
They are but very seldom, and but very few of them, allowed
to be acted. It was observed by Cicero, that nowhere were
the true opinions and feelings of the Romans so clearly shown
as at the theatre.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> In the autumn of 1816, a celebrated
improvisatore exhibited his talents at the Opera-house of
Milan. The reading of the theses handed in for the subjects
of his poetry was received by a very numerous audience, for
the most part in silence, or with laughter; but when the
assistant, unfolding one of the papers, exclaimed
<i>The apotheosis of Victor Alfieri</i>,
the whole theatre burst into a shout,
and the applause was continued for some moments. The
lot did not fall on Alfieri; and the Signor Sgricci had to
pour forth his extemporary common-places on the bombardment
of Algiers. The choice, indeed, is not left to accident
quite so much as might be thought from a first view of the
ceremony; and the police not only takes care to look at
the papers beforehand, but, in case of any prudential afterthought,
steps in to correct the blindness of chance. The
proposal for deifying Alfieri was received with immediate
enthusiasm, the rather because it was conjectured there
would be no opportunity of carrying it into effect.</p>

<p>There seems at least no reason why the name should not
have been put above the sentence which alludes to it.</p>

<p>It will readily be imagined that the prejudices which have
passed the name of Machiavelli into an epithet proverbial
of iniquity exist no longer at Florence. His memory was
persecuted, as his life had been, for an attachment to liberty
incompatible with the new system of despotism, which succeeded
the fall of the free governments of Italy. He was
put to the torture for being a "libertine," that is, for wishing
to restore the republic of Florence; and such are the undying
efforts of those who are interested in the perversion,
not only of the nature of actions, but the meaning of words,
that what was once <i>patriotism</i>, has by degrees come to
signify <i>debauch</i>. We have ourselves outlived the old meaning
of "liberality," which is now another word for treason in
one country and for infatuation in all. It seems to have
been a strange mistake to accuse the author of <i>The Prince</i>,
as being a pander to tyranny; and to think that the Inquisition
would condemn his work for such a delinquency. The
fact is, that Machiavelli, as is usual with those against whom
no crime can be proved, was suspected of and charged with
atheism; and the first and last most violent opposers of
<i>The Prince</i> were both Jesuits, one of whom persuaded the
Inquisition "bench&egrave; fosse tardo," to prohibit the treatise, and
the other qualified the secretary of the Florentine republic
as no better than a fool. The father Possevin was proved
never to have read the book, and the father Lucchesini not
to have understood it. It is clear, however, that such critics
must have objected not to the slavery of the doctrines, but to
the supposed tendency of a lesson which shows how distinct
are the interests of a monarch from the happiness of mankind.
The Jesuits are re-established in Italy, and the last
chapter of <i>The Prince</i> may again call forth a particular
refutation from those who are employed once more in moulding
the minds of the rising generation, so as to receive the
impressions of despotism. The chapter [xxvi.] bears for title,
"Esortazione a liberare l'Italia da' Barbari," and concludes
with a <i>libertine</i> excitement to the future redemption of Italy.

<span class="i0">Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="attrib"><a href="#C4_LVII">Stanza lvii.</a> line 1.</p>

<p>Dante was born in Florence, in the year 1261. He fought
in two battles, was fourteen times ambassador, and once
prior of the republic. When the party of Charles of Anjou
triumphed over the Bianchi, he was absent on an embassy
to Pope Boniface VIII., and was condemned to two years'
banishment, and to a fine of 8000 lire; on the non-payment
of which he was further punished by the sequestration of all
his property. The republic, however, was not content with
this satisfaction, for in 1772 was discovered in the archives
at Florence a sentence in which Dante is the eleventh of a
list of fifteen condemned in 1302 to be burnt alive;
<i>Talis perveniens igne comburatur sic quod moriatur</i>.
The pretext
for this judgment was a proof of unfair barter, extortions, and
illicit gains.
<i>Baracteriarum iniquarum extorsionum et illicitorum lucrorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>
and with such an accusation it is not
strange that Dante should have always protested his innocence,
and the injustice of his fellow-citizens. His appeal
to Florence was accompanied by another to the Emperor
Henry; and the death of that Sovereign in 1313 was the
signal for a sentence of irrevocable banishment. He had
before lingered near Tuscany with hopes of recall; then
travelled into the north of Italy, where Verona had to boast
of his longest residence; and he finally settled at Ravenna,
which was his ordinary but not constant abode until his
death. The refusal of the Venetians to grant him a public
audience, on the part of Guido Novello da Polenta, his protector,
is said to have been the principal cause of this event,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
which happened in 1321. He was buried ("in sacra minorum
&aelig;de") at Ravenna, in a handsome tomb, which was erected
by Guido, restored by Bernardo Bembo in 1483, pr&aelig;tor for
that republic which had refused to hear him, again restored
by Cardinal Corsi, in 1692, and replaced by a more magnificent
sepulchre, constructed in 1780 at the expense of the
Cardinal Luigi Valenti Gonzaga. The offence or misfortune
of Dante was an attachment to a defeated party, and, as his
least favourable biographers allege against him, too great a
freedom of speech and haughtiness of manner. But the next
age paid honours almost divine to the exile. The Florentines,
having in vain and frequently attempted to recover his body,
crowned his image in a church,<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> and his picture is still one
of the idols of their cathedral. They struck medals, they
raised statues to him. The cities of Italy, not being able to
dispute about his own birth, contended for that of his great
poem, and the Florentines thought it for their honour to
prove that he had finished the seventh Canto before they
drove him from his native city. Fifty-one years after his
death, they endowed a professorial chair for the expounding
of his verses, and Boccaccio was appointed to this patriotic
employment. The example was imitated by Bologna and
Pisa, and the commentators, if they performed but little
service to literature, augmented the veneration which beheld
a sacred or moral allegory in all the images of his mystic
muse. His birth and his infancy were discovered to have
been distinguished above those of ordinary men: the author
of the <i>Decameron</i>, his earliest biographer, relates that his
mother was warned in a dream of the importance of her
pregnancy: and it was found, by others, that at ten years of
age he had manifested his precocious passion for that wisdom
or theology, which, under the name of Beatrice, had been
mistaken for a substantial mistress. When the
<i>Divine Comedy</i> had been recognised as a mere mortal production,
and at the distance of two centuries, when criticism and
competition had sobered the judgment of the Italians, Dante
was seriously declared superior to Homer;<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
and though the
preference appeared to some casuists "an heretical blasphemy
worthy of the flames," the contest was vigorously
maintained for nearly fifty years. In later times it was made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
a question which of the Lords of Verona could boast of
having patronised him,<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
and the jealous scepticism of one
writer would not allow Ravenna the undoubted possession
of his bones. Even the critical Tiraboschi was inclined to
believe that the poet had foreseen and foretold one of the
discoveries of Galileo.&mdash;Like the great originals of other
nations, his popularity has not always maintained the same
level. The last age seemed inclined to undervalue him as a
model and a study: and Bettinelli one day rebuked his pupil
Monti, for poring over the harsh and obsolete extravagances
of the <i>Commedia</i>. The present generation having recovered
from the Gallic idolatries of Cesarotti, has returned to the
ancient worship, and the <i>Danteggiare</i> of the northern
Italians is thought even indiscreet by the more moderate
Tuscans.</p>

<p>There is still much curious information relative to the life
and writings of this great poet, which has not as yet been
collected even by the Italians; but the celebrated Ugo
Foscolo meditates to supply this defect, and it is not to be
regretted that this national work has been reserved for one
so devoted to his country and the cause of truth.</p>

and thrown into chains. The Avvogadori proposed to
behead him, but the supreme tribunal was content with the
sentence of imprisonment. Whilst Pisani was suffering this
unmerited disgrace, Chioza, in the vicinity of the capital,<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
was, by the assistance of the <i>Signor of Padua</i>, delivered into
the hands of Pietro Doria. At the intelligence of that
disaster, the great bell of St. Mark's tower tolled to arms, and
the people and the soldiery of the galleys were summoned to
the repulse of the approaching enemy; but they protested
they would not move a step, unless Pisani were liberated and
placed at their head. The great council was instantly
assembled: the prisoner was called before them, and the
Doge, Andrea Contarini, informed him of the demands of the
people, and the necessities of the state, whose only hope of
safety was reposed in his efforts, and who implored him to
forget the indignities he had endured in her service. "I
have submitted," replied the magnanimous republican,
"I have submitted to your deliberations without complaint;
I have supported patiently the pains of imprisonment, for
they were inflicted at your command: this is no time to
inquire whether I deserved them&mdash;the good of the republic
may have seemed to require it, and that which the republic
resolves is always resolved wisely. Behold me ready to lay
down my life for the preservation of my country." Pisani
was appointed generalissimo, and, by his exertions, in conjunction
with those of Carlo Zeno, the Venetians soon
recovered the ascendancy over their maritime rivals.</p>

<p>The Italian communities were no less unjust to their
citizens than the Greek republics. Liberty, both with the
one and the other, seems to have been a national, not an
individual object: and, notwithstanding the boasted
<i>equality before the laws</i>,
which an ancient Greek writer<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
considered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
the great distinctive mark between his countrymen and the
barbarians, the mutual rights of fellow citizens seem never to
have been the principal scope of the old democracies. The
world may have not yet seen an essay by the author of
<i>The Italian Republics</i>,
in which the distinction between the liberty
of former states, and the signification attached to that word
by the happier constitution of England, is ingeniously developed.
The Italians, however, when they had ceased to be
free, still looked back with a sigh upon those times of turbulence,
when every citizen might rise to a share of sovereign
power, and have never been taught fully to appreciate the
repose of a monarchy. Sperone Speroni, when Francis
Maria II. Duke of Rovere proposed the question, "which
was preferable, the republic or the principality&mdash;the perfect
and not durable, or the less perfect and not so liable to
change," replied, "that our happiness is to be measured by
its quality, not by its duration; and that he preferred to live
for one day like a man, than for a hundred years like a
brute, a stock, or a stone." This was thought, and called a
<i>magnificent</i> answer down to the last days of Italian
servitude.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>The Florentines did not take the opportunity of Petrarch's
short visit to their city in 1350 to revoke the decree which
confiscated the property of his father, who had been banished
shortly after the exile of Dante. His crown did not dazzle
them; but when in the next year they were in want of his
assistance in the formation of their university, they repented
of their injustice, and Boccaccio was sent to Padua to entreat
the laureate to conclude his wanderings in the bosom of his
native country, where he might finish his <i>immortal Africa</i>,
and enjoy, with his recovered possessions, the esteem of all
classes of his fellow citizens. They gave him the option of the

<p>Boccaccio was buried in the church of St. Michael and St.
James, at Certaldo, a small town in the Valdelsa, which was by
some supposed the place of his birth. There he passed the latter
part of his life in a course of laborious study, which shortened
his existence; and there might his ashes have been secure,
if not of honour, at least of repose. But the "hyena bigots" of
Certaldo tore up the tombstone of Boccaccio and ejected it
from the holy precincts of St. Michael and St. James. The
occasion, and, it may be hoped, the excuse, of this ejectment
was the making of a new floor for the church; but the fact
is, that the tombstone was taken up and thrown aside at the
bottom of the building. Ignorance may share the sin with
bigotry. It would be painful to relate such an exception to
the devotion of the Italians for their great names, could it
not be accompanied by a trait more honourably conformable
to the general character of the nation. The principal person
of the district, the last branch of the house of Medicis,
afforded that protection to the memory of the insulted dead
which her best ancestors had dispensed upon all contemporary
merit. The Marchioness Lenzoni rescued the tombstone
of Boccaccio from the neglect in which it had some
time lain, and found for it an honourable elevation in her
own mansion. She has done more: the house in which the
poet lived has been as little respected as his tomb, and is
falling to ruin over the head of one indifferent to the name
of its former tenant. It consists of two or three little
chambers, and a low tower, on which Cosmo II. affixed an
inscription. This house she has taken measures to purchase,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
and proposes to devote to it that care and consideration
which are attached to the cradle and to the roof of genius.</p>

<p>This is not the place to undertake the defence of Boccaccio;
but the man who exhausted his little patrimony in
the acquirement of learning, who was amongst the first, if
not the first, to allure the science and the poetry of Greece to
the bosom of Italy;&mdash;who not only invented a new style, but
founded, or certainly fixed, a new language; who, besides the
esteem of every polite court of Europe, was thought worthy
of employment by the predominant republic of his own
country, and, what is more, of the friendship of Petrarch, who
lived the life of a philosopher and a freeman, and who died
in the pursuit of knowledge,&mdash;such a man might have found
more consideration than he has met with from the priest of
Certaldo, and from a late English traveller, who strikes off his
portrait as an odious, contemptible, licentious writer, whose
impure remains should be suffered to rot without a record.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
That English traveller, unfortunately for those who have to
deplore the loss of a very amiable person, is beyond all
criticism; but the mortality which did not protect Boccaccio
from Mr. Eustace, must not defend Mr. Eustace from the
impartial judgment of his successors. Death may canonise
his virtues, not his errors; and it may be modestly pronounced
that he transgressed, not only as an author, but as a man,
when he evoked the shade of Boccaccio in company with
that of Aretine, amidst the sepulchres of Santa Croce, merely
to dismiss it with indignity. As far as respects</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Il flagello de' Principi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il divin Pietro Aretino,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-indent:0;">it is of little import what censure is passed upon a coxcomb
who owes his present existence to the above burlesque
character given to him by the poet, whose amber has preserved
many other grubs and worms: but to classify Boccaccio
with such a person, and to excommunicate his very
ashes, must of itself make us doubt of the qualification of the
classical tourist for writing upon Italian, or, indeed, upon
any other literature; for ignorance on one point may incapacitate
an author merely for that particular topic, but
subjection to a professional prejudice must render him an
unsafe director on all occasions. Any perversion and injustice
may be made what is vulgarly called a "case of conscience,"
and this poor excuse is all that can be offered for
the priest of Certaldo, or the author of the <i>Classical Tour</i>.
It would have answered the purpose to confine the censure
to the novels of Boccaccio; and gratitude to that source
which supplied the muse of Dryden with her last and most
harmonious numbers might, perhaps, have restricted that
censure to the objectionable qualities of the hundred tales.
At any rate the repentance of Boccaccio might have arrested
his exhumation, and it should have been recollected and told,
that in his old age he wrote a letter entreating his friend to
discourage the reading of the <i>Decameron</i>, for the sake of
modesty, and for the sake of the author, who would not have
an apologist always at hand to state in his excuse that he
wrote it when young, and at the command of his superiors.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
It is neither the licentiousness of the writer, nor the evil
propensities of the reader, which have given to the <i>Decameron</i>
alone, of all the works of Boccaccio, a perpetual popularity.
The establishment of a new and delightful dialect conferred
an immortality on the works in which it was first fixed. The
sonnets of Petrarch were, for the same reason, fated to survive
his self-admired <i>Africa</i>, "the favourite of kings." The
invariable traits of nature and feeling with which the novels,
as well as the verses, abound, have doubtless been the chief
source of the foreign celebrity of both authors; but Boccaccio,
as a man, is no more to be estimated by that work, than
Petrarch is to be regarded in no other light than as the lover
of Laura. Even, however, had the father of the Tuscan
prose been known only as the author of the <i>Decameron</i>, a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
considerate writer would have been cautious to pronounce a
sentence irreconcilable with the unerring voice of many ages
and nations. An irrevocable value has never been stamped
upon any work solely recommended by impurity.</p>

<p>The true source of the outcry against Boccaccio, which
began at a very early period, was the choice of his scandalous
personages in the cloisters as well as the courts; but
the princes only laughed at the gallant adventures so unjustly
charged upon queen Theodelinda, whilst the priesthood
cried shame upon the debauches drawn from the convent
and the hermitage; and most probably for the opposite
reason, namely, that the picture was faithful to the life.
Two of the novels are allowed to be facts usefully turned into
tales to deride the canonisation of rogues and laymen. Ser
Ciappelletto and Marcellinus are cited with applause even by
the decent Muratori.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>
The great Arnaud, as he is quoted
in Bayle, states, that a new edition of the novels was proposed,
of which the expurgation consisted in omitting the
words "monk" and "nun," and tacking the immoralities to
other names. The literary history of Italy particularises no
such edition; but it was not long before the whole of Europe
had but one opinion of the <i>Decameron</i>; and the absolution
of the author seems to have been a point settled at least a
hundred years ago: "On se feroit siffler si l' on pr&eacute;tendoit
convaincre Boccace de n'avoir pas &eacute;t&eacute; honn&ecirc;te homme, puis
qu'il a fait le D&eacute;cameron." So said one of the best men, and
perhaps the best critic that ever lived&mdash;the very martyr to
impartiality.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
But as this information, that in the beginning
of the last century one would have been hooted at for pretending
that Boccaccio was not a good man, may seem to
come from one of those enemies who are to be suspected,
even when they make us a present of truth, a more acceptable
contrast with the proscription of the body, soul, and
muse of Boccaccio may be found in a few words from the
virtuous, the patriotic contemporary, who thought one of the
tales of this impure writer worthy a Latin version from his own
pen. "I have remarked elsewhere," says Petrarch, writing
to Boccaccio, "that the book itself has been worried by certain
dogs, but stoutly defended by your staff and voice. Nor
was I astonished, for I have had proof of the vigour of your
mind, and I know you have fallen on that unaccommodating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
incapable race of mortals, who, whatever they either like not,
or know not, or cannot do, are sure to reprehend in others;
and on those occasions only put on a show of learning and
eloquence, but otherwise are entirely dumb."<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p>


<p>It is satisfactory to find that all the priesthood do not
resemble those of Certaldo, and that one of them who did not
possess the bones of Boccaccio would not lose the opportunity
of raising a cenotaph to his memory. Bevius, canon of Padua,
at the beginning of the sixteenth century, erected at Arqu&agrave;,
opposite to the tomb of the Laureate, a tablet, in which he
associated Boccaccio to the equal honours of Dante and of Petrarch.</p>

<p>Our veneration for the Medici begins with Cosmo and
expires with his grandson; that stream is pure only at the
source; and it is in search of some memorial of the virtuous
republicans of the family that we visit the church of St.
Lorenzo at Florence. The tawdry, glaring, unfinished chapel
in that church, designed for the mausoleum of the Dukes of
Tuscany, set round with crowns and coffins, gives birth to no
emotions but those of contempt for the lavish vanity of a race
of despots, whilst the pavement slab, simply inscribed to the
Father of his Country, reconciles us to the name of Medici.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
It was very natural for Corinna<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
to suppose that the statue
raised to the Duke of Urbino in the <i>capella de' depositi</i>, was
intended for his great namesake; but the magnificent Lorenzo
is only the sharer of a coffin half hidden in a niche of the
sacristy. The decay of Tuscany dates from the sovereignty
of the Medici. Of the sepulchral peace which succeeded to
the establishment of the reigning families in Italy, our own
Sidney has given us a glowing, but a faithful picture.
"Notwithstanding all the seditions of Florence, and other cities of
Tuscany, the horrid factions of Guelphs and Ghibelins, Neri
and Bianchi, nobles and commons, they continued populous,
strong, and exceeding rich; but in the space of less than a
hundred and fifty years, the peaceable reign of the Medices
is thought to have destroyed nine parts in ten of the people
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
of that province. Amongst other things it is remarkable,
that when Philip II. of Spain gave Sienna to the Duke of
Florence, his ambassador then at Rome sent him word, that
he had given away more than 650,000 subjects; and it is not
believed there are now 20,000 souls inhabiting that city and
territory. Pisa, Pistoia, Arezzo, Cortona, and other towns,
that were then good and populous, are in the like proportion
diminished, and Florence more than any. When that city
had been long troubled with seditions, tumults, and wars, for
the most part unprosperous, they still retained such strength,
that when Charles VIII. of France, being admitted as a
friend with his whole army, which soon after conquered the
kingdom of Naples, thought to master them, the people,
taking arms, struck such a terror into him, that he was glad
to depart upon such conditions as they thought fit to impose.
Machiavel reports, that in that time Florence alone, with the
Val d'Arno, a small territory belonging to that city, could, in
a few hours, by the sound of a bell, bring together 135,000
well-armed men; whereas now that city, with all the others
in that province, are brought to such despicable weakness,
emptiness, poverty, and baseness, that they can neither resist
the oppressions of their own prince, nor defend him or themselves
if they were assaulted by a foreign enemy. The people
are dispersed or destroyed, and the best families sent to seek
habitations in Venice, Genoa, Rome, Naples, and Lucca.
This is not the effect of war or pestilence; they enjoy a
perfect peace, and suffer no other plague than the government
they are under."<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
From the usurper Cosmo down to
the imbecile Gaston, we look in vain for any of those unmixed
qualities which should raise a patriot to the command of his
fellow-citizens. The Grand Dukes, and particularly the third
Cosmo, had operated so entire a change in the Tuscan
character, that the candid Florentines, in excuse for some
imperfections in the philanthropic system of Leopold, are
obliged to confess that the sovereign was the only liberal
man in his dominions. Yet that excellent prince himself
had no other notion of a national assembly, than of a body
to represent the wants and wishes, not the will of the people.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

upon the battle, that the earthquake, which overthrew in

of rapid streams, poured back the sea upon the rivers, and

Such is the description of Livy. It may be
doubted whether modern tactics would admit of such an abstraction.</p>

<p>The site of the battle of Thrasimene is not to be mistaken.
The traveller from the village under Cortona to Casa di
Piano, the next stage on the way to Rome, has for the first
two or three miles, around him, but more particularly to the
right, that flat land which Hannibal laid waste in order to
induce the Consul Flaminius to move from Arezzo. On his
left, and in front of him, is a ridge of hills bending down
towards the lake of Thrasimene, called by Livy "montes
Cortonenses," and now named the Gualandra. These hills
he approaches at Ossaja, a village which the itineraries pretend
to have been so denominated from the bones found
there: but there have been no bones found there, and the
battle was fought on the other side of the hill. From Ossaja
the road begins to rise a little, but does not pass into the
roots of the mountains until the sixty-seventh milestone
from Florence. The ascent thence is not steep but perpetual,
and continues for twenty minutes. The lake is soon
seen below on the right, with Borghetto, a round tower, close
upon the water; and the undulating hills partially covered
with wood, amongst which the road winds, sink by degrees
into the marshes near to this tower. Lower than the road,
down to the right amidst these woody hillocks, Hannibal
placed his horse,<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
in the jaws of, or rather above the pass,
which was between the lake and the present road, and most
probably close to Borghetto, just under the lowest of the
"tumuli."<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> On a summit to the left, above the road, is an
old circular ruin, which the peasants call "the tower of
Hannibal the Carthaginian." Arrived at the highest point
of the road, the traveller has a partial view of the fatal plain,
which opens fully upon him as he descends the Gualandra.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
He soon finds himself in a vale enclosed to the left, and in
front and behind him by the Gualandra hills, bending round
in a segment larger than a semicircle, and running down at
each end to the lake, which obliques to the right and forms
the chord of this mountain arc. The position cannot be
guessed at from the plains of Cortona, nor appears to be so
completely enclosed unless to one who is fairly within the
hills. It then, indeed, appears "a place made as it were
on purpose for a snare," <i>locus insidiis natus</i>. "Borghetto
is then found to stand in a narrow marshy pass close to the
hill, and to the lake, whilst there is no other outlet at the
opposite turn of the mountains than through the little town
of Passignano, which is pushed into the water by the foot of
a high rocky acclivity." There is a woody eminence branching
down from the mountains into the upper end of the
plain nearer to the side of Passignano, and on this stands a
white village called Torre. Polybius seems to allude to this
eminence as the one on which Hannibal encamped, and
drew out his heavy-armed Africans and Spaniards in a
conspicuous position.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> From this spot he despatched his
Balearic and light-armed troops round through the Gualandra
heights to the right, so as to arrive unseen and form
an ambush amongst the broken acclivities which the road
now passes, and to be ready to act upon the left flank and
above the enemy, whilst the horse shut up the pass behind.
Flaminius came to the lake near Borghetto at sunset; and,
without sending any spies before him, marched through the
pass the next morning before the day had quite broken, so
that he perceived nothing of the horse and light troops above
and about him, and saw only the heavy-armed Carthaginians
in front on the hill of Torre. The consul began to
draw out his army in the flat, and in the mean time the
horse in ambush occupied the pass behind him at Borghetto.
Thus the Romans were completely enclosed, having the lake
on the right, the main army on the hill of Torre in front, the
Gualandra hills filled with the light-armed on their left flank,
and being prevented from receding by the cavalry, who, the
further they advanced, stopped up all the outlets in the rear.
A fog rising from the lake now spread itself over the army
of the consul, but the high lands were in the sunshine, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
all the different corps in ambush looked towards the hill of
Torre for the order of attack. Hannibal gave the signal,
and moved down from his post on the height. At the same
moment all his troops on the eminences behind and in the
flank of Flaminius rushed forwards as it were with one accord
into the plain. The Romans, who were forming their array
in the mist, suddenly heard the shouts of the enemy amongst
them on every side, and before they could fall into their
ranks, or draw their swords, or see by whom they were
attacked, felt at once that they were surrounded and lost.</p>

<p>There are two little rivulets which run from the Gualandra
into the lake. The traveller crosses the first of these
at about a mile after he comes into the plain, and this
divides the Tuscan from the Papal territories. The second,
about a quarter of a mile further on, is called "the bloody
rivulet;" and the peasants point out an open spot to the left
between the "Sanguinetto" and the hills, which, they say,
was the principal scene of slaughter. The other part of
the plain is covered with thick-set olive-trees in corn grounds,
and is nowhere quite level, except near the edge of the lake.
It is, indeed, most probable that the battle was fought near
this end of the valley, for the six thousand Romans, who, at
the beginning of the action, broke through the enemy,
escaped to the summit of an eminence which must have been
in this quarter, otherwise they would have had to traverse
the whole plain, and to pierce through the main army of Hannibal.</p>

<p>The Romans fought desperately for three hours; but the
death of Flaminius was the signal for a general dispersion.
The Carthaginian horse then burst in upon the fugitives, and
the lake, the marsh about Borghetto, but chiefly the plain of
the Sanguinetto and the passes of the Gualandra, were strewed
with dead. Near some old walls on a bleak ridge to the left
above the rivulet, many human bones have been repeatedly
found, and this has confirmed the pretensions and the name
of the "stream of blood."</p>

<p>Every district of Italy has its hero. In the north some
painter is the usual genius of the place, and the foreign Julio
Romano more than divides Mantua with her native Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
To the south we hear of Roman names. Near Thrasimene
tradition is still faithful to the fame of an enemy, and Hannibal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
the Carthaginian is the only ancient name remembered on
the banks of the Perugian lake. Flaminius is unknown;
but the postilions on that road have been taught to show the
very spot where <i>Il Console Romano</i> was slain. Of all who
fought and fell in the battle of Thrasimene, the historian
himself has, besides the generals and Maharbal, preserved
indeed only a single name. You overtake the Carthaginian
again on the same road to Rome. The antiquary, that is,
the hostler of the posthouse at Spoleto, tells you that his
town repulsed the victorious enemy, and shows you the gate
still called <i>Porta di Annibale</i>. It is hardly worth while to
remark that a French travel writer, well known by the name
of the President Dupaty, saw Thrasimene in the lake of
Bolsena, which lay conveniently on his way from Sienna to Rome.</p>

<p>The projected division of the Spada Pompey has already
been recorded by the historian of the <i>Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire</i>. Mr. Gibbon found it in the memorials
of Flaminius Vacca; and it may be added to his mention of
it, that Pope Julius III. gave the contending owners five
hundred crowns for the statue, and presented it to Cardinal
Capo di Ferro, who had prevented the judgment of Solomon
from being executed upon the image. In a more civilised
age this statue was exposed to an actual operation: for the
French, who acted the Brutus of Voltaire in the Coliseum,
resolved that their C&aelig;sar should fall at the base of that
Pompey, which was supposed to have been sprinkled with
the blood of the original dictator. The nine-foot hero was
therefore removed to the arena of the amphitheatre, and, to
facilitate its transport, suffered the temporary amputation
of its right arm. The republican tragedians had to plead
that the arm was a restoration: but their accusers do not
believe that the integrity of the statue would have protected
it. The love of finding every coincidence, has discovered
the true C&aelig;sarian ichor in a stain near the right knee; but
colder criticism has rejected not only the blood, but the
portrait, and assigned the globe of power rather to the first
of the emperors than to the last of the republican masters
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
of Rome. Winckelmann<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
is loth to allow an heroic statue
of a Roman citizen, but the Grimani Agrippa, a contemporary
almost, is heroic; and naked Roman figures were
only very rare, not absolutely forbidden. The face accords
much better with the "hominem integrum et castum et gravem,"<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>
than with any of the busts of Augustus, and is too
stern for him who was beautiful, says Suetonius, at all
periods of his life. The pretended likeness to Alexander
the Great cannot be discerned, but the traits resemble the
medal of Pompey.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>
The objectionable globe may not have
been an ill-applied flattery to him who found Asia Minor the
boundary, and left it the centre of the Roman empire. It
seems that Winckelmann has made a mistake in thinking
that no proof of the identity of this statue with that which
received the bloody sacrifice can be derived from the spot
where it was discovered.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
Flaminius Vacca says
<i>sotto una cantina</i>, and this cantina is known to have been in the
Vicolo de' Leutari, near the Cancellaria; a position corresponding
exactly to that of the Janus before the basilica of
Pompey's theatre, to which Augustus transferred the statue
after the <i>curia</i> was either burnt or taken down.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>
Part of the "Pompeian shade,"<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
the portico, existed in the beginning
of the XVth century, and the <i>atrium</i> was still called
<i>Satrum</i>. So says Blondus.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
At all events, so imposing is
the stern majesty of the statue, and so memorable is the
story, that the play of the imagination leaves no room for
the exercise of the judgment, and the fiction, if a fiction it is,
operates on the spectator with an effect not less powerful
than truth.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>Ancient Rome, like modern Sienna, abounded most probably
with images of the foster-mother of her founder; but
there were two she-wolves of whom history makes particular
mention. One of these, <i>of brass in ancient work</i>, was seen
by Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>
at the temple of Romulus, under the Palatine,
and is universally believed to be that mentioned by the
Latin historian, as having been made from the money collected
by a fine on usurers, and as standing under the
Ruminal fig-tree.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>
The other was that which Cicero<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> has
celebrated both in prose and verse, and which the historian
Dion also records as having suffered the same accident as is
alluded to by the orator.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
The question agitated by the
antiquaries is, whether the wolf now in the Conservator's
Palace is that of Livy and Dionysius, or that of Cicero, or
whether it is neither one nor the other. The earlier writers
differ as much as the moderns: Lucius Faunus<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>
says, that
it is the one alluded to by both, which is impossible, and
also by Virgil, which may be. Fulvius Ursinus<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
calls it the
wolf of Dionysius, and Marlianus<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
talks of it as the one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
mentioned by Cicero. To him Rycquius <i>tremblingly</i> assents.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
Nardini is inclined to suppose it may be one of the many
wolves preserved in ancient Rome; but of the two rather
bends to the Ciceronian statue.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>
Montfaucon<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
mentions it
as a point without doubt. Of the latter writers the decisive
Winckelmann<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
proclaims it as having been found at the
church of Saint Theodore, where, or near where, was the
temple of Romulus, and consequently makes it the wolf of
Dionysius. His authority is Lucius Faunus, who, however,
only says that it <i>was placed</i>, not <i>found</i>,
at the Ficus Ruminalis,
by the Comitium, by which he does not seem to allude
to the church of Saint Theodore. Rycquius was the first to
make the mistake, and Winckelmann followed Rycquius.</p>

<p>Flaminius Vacca tells quite a different story, and says he
had heard the wolf with the twins was found<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
near the arch
of Septimius Severus. The commentator on Winckelmann
is of the same opinion with that learned person, and is
incensed at Nardini for not having remarked that Cicero, in
speaking of the wolf struck with lightning in the Capitol,
makes use of the past tense. But, with the Abate's leave,
Nardini does not positively assert the statue to be that
mentioned by Cicero, and if he had, the assumption would
not perhaps have been so exceedingly indiscreet. The Abate
himself is obliged to own that there are marks very like the
scathing of lightning in the hinder legs of the present wolf;
and, to get rid of this, adds, that the wolf seen by Dionysius
might have been also struck by lightning, or otherwise injured.</p>

<p>Let us examine the subject by a reference to the words of
Cicero. The orator in two places seems to particularise the
Romulus and the Remus, especially the first, which his audience
remembered to <i>have been</i> in the Capitol, as being
struck with lightning. In his verses he records that the
twins and wolf both fell, and that the latter left behind the
marks of her feet. Cicero does not say that the wolf was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
consumed: and Dion only mentions that it fell down, without
alluding, as the Abate has made him, to the force of the
blow, or the firmness with which it had been fixed. The
whole strength, therefore, of the Abate's argument hangs
upon the past tense; which, however, may be somewhat
diminished by remarking that the phrase only shows that
the statue was not then standing in its former position.
Winckelmann has observed that the present twins are
modern; and it is equally clear that there are marks of
gilding on the wolf, which might therefore be supposed to
make part of the ancient group. It is known that the sacred
images of the Capitol were not destroyed when injured by
time or accident, but were put into certain underground
depositories, called <i>faviss&aelig;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
It may be thought possible
that the wolf had been so deposited, and had been replaced
in some conspicuous situation when the Capitol was rebuilt
by Vespasian. Rycquius, without mentioning his authority,
tells that it was transferred from the Comitium to the
Lateran, and thence brought to the Capitol. If it was found
near the arch of Severus, it may have been one of the images
which Orosius<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
says was thrown down in the Forum by
lightning when Alaric took the city. That it is of very high
antiquity the workmanship is a decisive proof; and that
circumstance induced Winckelmann to believe it the wolf of
Dionysius. The Capitoline wolf, however, may have been
of the same early date as that at the temple of Romulus.
Lactantius<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>
asserts that in his time the Romans worshipped
a wolf; and it is known that the Lupercalia held out to a
very late period<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>
after every other observance of the ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
superstition had totally expired. This may account for the
preservation of the ancient image longer than the other early
symbols of Paganism.</p>

<p>It may be permitted, however, to remark, that the wolf was
a Roman symbol, but that the worship of that symbol is an
inference drawn by the zeal of Lactantius. The early Christian
writers are not to be trusted in the charges which they
make against the Pagans. Eusebius accused the Romans
to their faces of worshipping Simon Magus, and raising a
statue to him in the island of the Tyber. The Romans had
probably never heard of such a person before, who came,
however, to play a considerable, though scandalous part in
the church history, and has left several tokens of his a&euml;rial
combat with St. Peter at Rome; notwithstanding that an
inscription found in this very island of the Tyber showed the
Simon Magus of Eusebius to be a certain indigenal god
called Semo Sangus or Fidius.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a></p>


<p>Even when the worship of the founder of Rome had been
abandoned it was thought expedient to humour the habits of
the good matrons of the city, by sending them with their
sick infants to the church of Saint Theodore, as they had
before carried them to the temple of Romulus.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
The practice
is continued to this day; and the site of the above
church seems to be thereby identified with that of the temple;
so that if the wolf had been really found there, as Winckelmann
says, there would be no doubt of the present statue
being that seen by Dionysius.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
But Faunus, in saying that
it was at the Ficus Ruminalis by the Comitium, is only talking
of its ancient position as recorded by Pliny; and, even if
he had been remarking where it was found, would not have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
alluded to the church of Saint Theodore, but to a very
different place, near which it was then thought the Ficus
Ruminalis had been, and also the Comitium; that is, the
three columns by the church of Santa Maria Liberatrice, at
the corner of the Palatine looking on the Forum.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, a mere conjecture where the image was
actually dug up; and perhaps, on the whole, the marks of
the gilding, and of the lightning, are a better argument in
favour of its being the Ciceronian wolf than any that can be
adduced for the contrary opinion. At any rate, it is reasonably
selected in the text of the poem as one of the most
interesting relics of the ancient city,<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>
and is certainly the
figure, if not the very animal to which Virgil alludes in his
beautiful verses:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is possible to be a very great man and to be still very
inferior to Julius C&aelig;sar, the most complete character, so
Lord Bacon thought, of all antiquity. Nature seems incapable
of such extraordinary combinations as composed
his versatile capacity, which was the wonder even of the
Romans themselves. The first general&mdash;the only triumphant
politician&mdash;inferior to none in eloquence&mdash;comparable to any
in the attainments of wisdom, in an age made up of the
greatest commanders, statesmen, orators, and philosophers
that ever appeared in the world&mdash;an author who composed
a perfect specimen of military annals in his travelling carriage&mdash;at
one time in a controversy with Cato, at another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
writing a treatise on punning, and collecting a set of good
sayings&mdash;fighting and making love at the same moment, and
willing to abandon both his empire and his mistress for a
sight of the Fountains of the Nile. Such did Julius C&aelig;sar
appear to his contemporaries, and to those of the subsequent
ages who were the most inclined to deplore and execrate
his fatal genius.</p>

<p>But we must not be so much dazzled with his surpassing
glory, or with his magnanimous, his amiable qualities, as to
forget the decision of his impartial countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<p>The respectable authority of Flaminius Vacca would
incline us to believe in the claims of the Egerian grotto.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>
He assures us that he saw an inscription in the pavement,
stating that the fountain was that of Egeria, dedicated to the
nymphs. The inscription is not there at this day, but Montfaucon
quotes two lines<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>
of Ovid [<i>Fast.</i>, iii. 275, 276] from a
stone in the Villa Giustiniani, which he seems to think had
been brought from the same grotto.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>This grotto and valley were formerly frequented in summer,
and particularly the first Sunday in May, by the modern
Romans, who attached a salubrious quality to the fountain
which trickles from an orifice at the bottom of the vault, and,
overflowing the little pools, creeps down the matted grass
into the brook below. The brook is the Ovidian Almo,
whose name and qualities are lost in the modern Aquataccio.
The valley itself is called Valle di Caffarelli, from the dukes
of that name who made over their fountain to the Pallavicini,
with sixty <i>rubbia</i> of adjoining land.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this long dell is the Egerian
valley of Juvenal, and the pausing place of Umbritius, notwithstanding
the generality of his commentators have supposed
the descent of the satirist and his friend to have been
into the Arician grove, where the nymph met Hippolitus,
and where she was more peculiarly worshipped.</p>

<p>The step from the Porta Capena to the Alban hill, fifteen
miles distant, would be too considerable, unless we were to
believe in the wild conjecture of Vossius, who makes that
gate travel from its present station, where he pretends it was
during the reign of the Kings, as far as the Arician grove,
and then makes it recede to its old site with the shrinking
city.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
The tufo, or pumice, which the poet prefers to marble,
is the substance composing the bank in which the grotto is sunk.</p>

<p>The modern topographers<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
find in the grotto the statue of
the nymph, and nine niches for the Muses; and a late
traveller<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
has discovered that the cave is restored to that
simplicity which the poet regretted had been exchanged for
injudicious ornament. But the headless statue is palpably
rather a male than a nymph, and has none of the attributes
ascribed to it at present visible. The nine Muses could
hardly have stood in six niches; and Juvenal certainly does
not allude to any individual cave.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
Nothing can be collected
from the satirist but that somewhere near the Porta Capena
was a spot in which it was supposed Numa held nightly consultations
with his nymph, and where there was a grove and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
a sacred fountain, and fanes once consecrated to the Muses;
and that from this spot there was a descent into the valley
of Egeria, where were several artificial caves. It is clear
that the statues of the Muses made no part of the decoration
which the satirist thought misplaced in these caves; for he
expressly assigns other fanes (<i>delubra</i>) to these divinities
above the valley, and moreover tells us that they had been
ejected to make room for the Jews. In fact, the little temple
now called that of Bacchus, was formerly thought to belong
to the Muses, and Nardini<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>
places them in a poplar grove,
which was in his time above the valley.</p>

<p>It is probable from the inscription and position, that the
cave now shown may be one of the "artificial caverns," of
which, indeed, there is another a little way higher up the
valley, under a tuft of alder bushes; but a <i>single</i> grotto of
Egeria is a mere modern invention, grafted upon the application
of the epithet Egerian to these nymphea in general, and
which might send us to look for the haunts of Numa upon
the banks of the Thames.</p>

<p>Our English Juvenal was not seduced into mistranslation
by his acquaintance with Pope: he carefully preserves the
correct plural&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"Thence slowly winding down the vale we view<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Egerian <i>grots</i>: oh, how unlike the true!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The valley abounds with springs,<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
and over these springs,
which the Muses might haunt from their neighbouring
groves, Egeria presided: hence she was said to supply them
with water; and she was the nymph of the grottos through
which the fountains were taught to flow.</p>

<p>The whole of the monuments in the vicinity of the Egerian
valley have received names at will, which have been changed
at will. Venuti<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>
owns he can see no traces of the temples
of Jove, Saturn, Juno, Venus, and Diana, which Nardini
found, or hoped to find. The mutatorium of Caracalla's
circus, the temple of Honour and Virtue, the temple of
Bacchus, and, above all, the temple of the god Rediculus,
are the antiquaries' despair.</p>

<p>The circus of Caracalla depends on a medal of that
emperor cited by Fulvius Ursinus, of which the reverse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
shows a circus, supposed, however, by some to represent the
Circus Maximus. It gives a very good idea of that place of
exercise. The soil has been but little raised, if we may
judge from the small cellular structure at the end of the
Spina, which was probably the chapel of the god Consus.
This cell is half beneath the soil, as it must have been in the
circus itself; for Dionysius<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
could not be persuaded to
believe that this divinity was the Roman Neptune, because
his altar was underground.</p>

<p>We read in Suetonius, that Augustus, from a warning
received in a dream,<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
counterfeited, once a year, the beggar,
sitting before the gate of his palace with his hand hollowed
and stretched out for charity. A statue formerly in the
villa Borghese, and which should be now at Paris, represents
the Emperor in that posture of supplication. The object of
that self-degradation was the appeasement of Nemesis, the
perpetual attendant on good fortune, of whose power the
Roman conquerors were also reminded by certain symbols
attached to their cars of triumph. The symbols were the
whip and the <i>crotalo</i>, which were discovered in the Nemesis
of the Vatican. The attitude of beggary made the above
statue pass for that of Belisarius: and until the criticism of
Winckelmann<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
had rectified the mistake, one fiction was called
in to support another. It was the same fear of the sudden
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
termination of prosperity, that made Amasis king of Egypt
warn his friend Polycrates of Samos, that the gods loved
those whose lives were chequered with good and evil fortunes.
Nemesis was supposed to lie in wait particularly for
the prudent; that is, for those whose caution rendered them
accessible only to mere accidents; and her first altar was
raised on the banks of the Phrygian &AElig;sepus by Adrastus,
probably the prince of that name who killed the son of
Croesus by mistake. Hence the goddess was called Adrastea.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>


<p>The Roman Nemesis was <i>sacred</i> and <i>august</i>: there was a
temple to her in the Palatine under the name of Rhamnusia;<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
so great, indeed, was the propensity of the ancients
to trust to the revolution of events, and to believe in the
divinity of Fortune, that in the same Palatine there was a
temple to the Fortune of the day.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>
This is the last superstition
which retains its hold over the human heart; and,
from concentrating in one object the credulity so natural to
man, has always appeared strongest in those unembarrassed
by other articles of belief. The antiquaries have supposed
this goddess to be synonymous with Fortune and with Fate;<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>
but it was in her vindictive quality that she was worshipped

<p>Gladiators were of two kinds, compelled and voluntary;
and were supplied from several conditions;&mdash;from slaves
sold for that purpose; from culprits; from barbarian captives
either taken in war, and, after being led in triumph, set
apart for the games, or those seized and condemned as
rebels; also from free citizens, some fighting for hire
(<i>auctorati</i>), others from a depraved ambition; at last even
knights and senators were exhibited,&mdash;a disgrace of which

In the end,

to the human race as these sports. In spite of the laws of
Constantine and Constans, gladiatorial shows survived the
old established religion more than seventy years; but they
owed their final extinction to the courage of a Christian. In
the year 404, on the kalends of January, they were exhibiting
the shows in the Flavian amphitheatre before the usual
immense concourse of people. Almachius, or Telemachus,
an Eastern monk, who had travelled to Rome intent on his
holy purpose, rushed into the midst of the arena, and endeavoured
to separate the combatants. The Pr&aelig;tor Alypius,
a person incredibly attached to these games,<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
gave instant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
orders to the gladiators to slay him; and Telemachus gained
the crown of martyrdom, and the title of saint, which surely
has never either before or since been awarded for a more
noble exploit. Honorius immediately abolished the shows,
which were never afterwards revived. The story is told by
Theodoret<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
and Cassiodorus,<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
and seems worthy of credit
notwithstanding its place in the Roman martyrology.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
Besides
the torrents of blood which flowed at the funerals, in
the amphitheatres, the circus, the forums, and other public
places, gladiators were introduced at feasts, and tore each
other to pieces amidst the supper tables, to the great delight
and applause of the guests. Yet Lipsius permits himself to
suppose the loss of courage, and the evident degeneracy of
mankind, to be nearly connected with the abolition of these
bloody spectacles.</p>

<p class="attrib"><a href="#C4_CXLII">Stanza cxlii.</a> lines 5 and 6.</p>

<p>When one gladiator wounded another, he shouted, "He
has it," "Hoc habet," or "Habet." The wounded combatant
dropped his weapon, and advancing to the edge of the arena,
supplicated the spectators. If he had fought well, the
people saved him; if otherwise, or as they happened to be
inclined, they turned down their thumbs, and he was slain.
They were occasionally so savage that they were impatient
if a combat lasted longer than ordinary without wounds or
death. The emperor's presence generally saved the vanquished;
and it is recorded, as an instance of Caracalla's
ferocity, that he sent those who supplicated him for life, in
a spectacle, at Nicomedia, to ask the people; in other
words, handed them over to be slain. A similar ceremony
is observed at the Spanish bull-fights. The magistrate
presides; and after the horseman and piccadores have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
fought the bull, the matadore steps forward and bows to
him for permission to kill the animal. If the bull has done
his duty by killing two or three horses, or a man, which last
is rare, the people interfere with shouts, the ladies wave
their handkerchiefs, and the animal is saved. The wounds
and death of the horses are accompanied with the loudest
acclamations, and many gestures of delight, especially from
the female portion of the audience, including those of the
gentlest blood. Every thing depends on habit. The author
of <i>Childe Harold</i>, the writer of this note, and one or two
other Englishmen, who have certainly in other days borne
the sight of a pitched battle, were, during the summer of
1809, in the governor's box at the great amphitheatre of
Santa Maria, opposite to Cadiz. The death of one or two
horses completely satisfied their curiosity. A gentleman
present, observing them shudder and look pale, noticed that
unusual reception of so delightful a sport to some young
ladies, who stared and smiled, and continued their applause
as another horse fell bleeding to the ground. One bull killed
three horses, <i>off his own horns</i>. He was saved by acclamations,
which were redoubled when it was known he belonged to a priest.</p>

<p>An Englishman who can be much pleased with seeing two
men beat themselves to pieces, cannot bear to look at a
horse galloping round an arena with his bowels trailing on
the ground, and turns from the spectacle and the spectators
with horror and disgust.</p>

<p class="attrib"><a href="#C4_CLXXIV">Stanza clxxiv.</a> lines 3 and 4.</p>

<p>The whole declivity of the Alban hill is of unrivalled
beauty, and from the convent on the highest point, which
has succeeded to the temple of the Latian Jupiter, the prospect
embraces all the objects alluded to in the cited stanza;
the Mediterranean; the whole scene of the latter half of the
<i>&AElig;neid</i>, and the coast from beyond the mouth of the Tiber
to the headland of Circ&aelig;um and the Cape of Terracina.</p>

<p>The site of Cicero's villa may be supposed either at the
Grotta Ferrata, or at the Tusculum of Prince Lucien
Buonaparte.</p>

<p>The former was thought some years ago the actual site,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
as may be seen from Myddleton's <i>Life of Cicero</i>. At present
it has lost something of its credit, except for the Domenichinos.
Nine monks of the Greek order live there, and the
adjoining villa is a cardinal's summer-house. The other
villa, called Rufinella, is on the summit of the hill above
Frascati, and many rich remains of Tusculum have been
found there, besides seventy-two statues of different merit
and preservation, and seven busts.</p>

<p>From the same eminence are seen the Sabine hills, embosomed
in which lies the long valley of Rustica. There
are several circumstances which tend to establish the identity
of this valley with the "<i>Ustica</i>" of Horace; and it seems
possible that the mosaic pavement which the peasants
uncover by throwing up the earth of a vineyard may belong
to his villa. Rustica is pronounced short, not according to
our stress upon&mdash;"<i>Ustic&aelig; cubantis</i>." It is more rational to
think that we are wrong, than that the inhabitants of this
secluded valley have changed their tone in this word. The
addition of the consonant prefixed is nothing; yet it is
necessary to be aware that Rustica may be a modern name
which the peasants may have caught from the antiquaries.</p>

<p>The villa, or the mosaic, is in a vineyard on a knoll covered
with chestnut trees. A stream runs down the valley; and
although it is not true, as said in the guide books, that this
stream is called Licenza, yet there is a village on a rock at
the head of the valley, which is so denominated, and which
may have taken its name from the Digentia. Licenza contains
seven hundred inhabitants. On a peak a little way
beyond is Civitella, containing three hundred. On the
banks of the Anio, a little before you turn up into Valle
Rustica, to the left, about an hour from the <i>villa</i>, is a town
called Vicovaro, another favourable coincidence with the
<i>Varia</i> of the poet. At the end of the valley, towards the
Anio, there is a bare hill, crowned with a little town called
Bardela. At the foot of this hill the rivulet of Licenza flows,
and is almost absorbed in a wide sandy bed before it reaches
the Anio. Nothing can be more fortunate for the lines of
the poet, whether in a metaphorical or direct sense:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Me quotiens reficit gelidus Digentia rivus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quem Mandela bibit rugosus frigore pagus."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">The stream is clear high up the valley, but before it reaches
the hill of Bardela looks green and yellow like a sulphur rivulet.</p>

<p>Rocca Giovane, a ruined village in the hills, half an hour's
walk from the vineyard where the pavement is shown, does
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
seem to be the site of the fane of Vacuna, and an inscription
found there tells that this temple of the Sabine Victory was
repaired by Vespasian. With these helps, and a position
corresponding exactly to every thing which the poet has
told us of his retreat, we may feel tolerably secure of our site.</p>

<p>The hill which should be Lucretilis is called Campanile,
and by following up the rivulet to the pretended Bandusia,
you come to the roots of the higher mountain Gennaro.
Singularly enough, the only spot of ploughed land in the
whole valley is on the knoll where this Bandusia rises.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">" ... tu frigus amabile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fessis vomere tauris<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pr&aelig;bes, et pecori vago."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">The peasants show another spring near the mosaic pavement,
which they call "Oradina," and which flows down the
hills into a tank, or mill-dam, and thence trickles over into
the Digentia.</p>

<p>But we must not hope</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To trace the Muses upwards to their spring,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent:0;">by exploring the windings of the romantic valley in search
of the Bandusian fountain. It seems strange that any one
should have thought Bandusia a fountain of the Digentia&mdash;Horace
has not let drop a word of it; and this immortal
spring has in fact been discovered in possession of the
holders of many good things in Italy, the monks. It was
attached to the church of St. Gervais and Protais near
Venusia, where it was most likely to be found.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
We shall
not be so lucky as a late traveller in finding the "occasional
pine" still pendent on the poetic villa. There is not a pine in
the whole valley, but there are two cypresses, which he evidently
took, or mistook, for the tree in the ode.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>
The truth
is, that the pine is now, as it was in the days of Virgil, a
garden tree, and it was not at all likely to be found in the
craggy acclivities of the valley of Rustica. Horace probably
had one of them in the orchard close above his farm, immediately
overshadowing his villa, not on the rocky heights at
some distance from his abode. The tourist may have easily
supposed himself to have seen this pine figured in the above
cypresses; for the orange and lemon trees which throw such
a bloom over his description of the royal gardens at Naples,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
unless they have been since displaced, were assuredly only
acacias and other common garden shrubs.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a></p>

survived their liberties. Titius, the friend of Antony, presented them
with games in the theatre of Pompey. They did not suffer the brilliancy
of the spectacle to efface from their memory that the man who furnished
them with the entertainment had murdered the son of Pompey: they drove
him from the theatre with curses. The moral sense of a populace,
spontaneously expressed, is never wrong. Even the soldiers of the
triumvirs joined in the execration of the citizens, by shouting round
the chariots of Lepidus and Plancus, who had proscribed their brothers,
<i>De Germanis, non de Gallis, duo triumphant consules</i>; a saying worth a
record, were it nothing but a good pun. [C. Vell. Paterculi, <i>Hist</i>.,

genius is more odious and more contemptible than its absence, and it
imports little where the impure remains of a licentious author are
consigned to their kindred dust. For the same reason the traveller may
pass unnoticed the tomb of the malignant <i>Aretino</i>." This dubious phrase
is hardly enough to save the tourist from the suspicion of another
blunder respecting the burial-place of Aretine, whose tomb was in the
church of St. Luke at Venice, and gave rise to the famous controversy of
which some notice is taken in Bayle. Now the words of Mr. Eustace would
lead us to think the tomb was at Florence, or at least was to be
somewhere recognised. Whether the inscription so much disputed was ever
written on the tomb cannot now be decided, for all memorial of this
author has disappeared from the church of St. Luke.</p></div>

say, he would rather adore a wolf than a prostitute. His commentator has
observed that the opinion of Livy concerning Laurentia being figured in
this wolf was not universal. Strabo thought so. Rycquius is wrong in
saying that Lactantius mentions the wolf was in the Capitol.</p></div>
